  This document describes how to set up a touch screen input device
  under XFree86. As the author had only the opportunity to work with
  devices from EloTouch(R) and MicroTouch(R) this HOWTO is rather spe-
  cific for these devices. The examples given in this HOWTO concentrate
  on devices connected via the serial port i.e. /dev/ttyS0 or
  /dev/ttyS1.  (Information about USB devices would be appreciated!)

  1.  How to configure the device

  Touch screen devices are configured in the Xinput section in the
  XF86Config file (mostly /etc/X11/XF86Config or /etc/XF86Config).  At
  first verify that the device driver modules exist. They are located in
  /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/ (the modules for the above mentioned devices
  are xf86Elo.so and xf86MuTouch.so). Now have a look into XF86Config.
  There should be a section looking like this:


  Section "Files"
  ...
  ModulePath "/usr/X11R6/lib/modules"
  ...
  EndSection



  To get the module loaded by the X server there has to be a section
  like this:


  Section "Module"
  Load "xf86Elo.so"
  EndSection



  Now the more tricky part. X needs to know some parameters about the
  device.  The section for this looks like this (see "man XF86Config"
  for more details):



  Section "Xinput"
   SubSection "Elographics"
  #the entry for a MicroTouch device would be SubSection "MicrotouchFinger"
    Port "/dev/ttyS1" # for a device at serial port 2
    DeviceName "TouchScreen" #could be any unambiguous name
    MinimumXPosition 300
    MaximumXPosition 3700
    MinimumYPosition 300
    MaximumYPosition 3700
    UntouchDelay 10 #not supported with MuTouch
    ReportDelay 10  #not supported with MuTouch
    AlwaysCore #activates the device on startup
   EndSubSection
  EndSection



  The values for the entries MinimumXPosition etc. are of course
  specific for the setup of the hardware (i.e. depend on the position of
  the touch screen relative to the monitor). The values determine where
  the points (0,0) and (xmax,ymax) on your monitor (xmax and ymax depend
  on the resolution chosen for the Xserver, such as 1024x768) are mapped
  on the touch screen.  The device driver reads these values and
  interpolishes the other coordinates.  For illustration:


   --------------touch screen area-----------------
   I                                              I
   I  ########visible monitor area##############  I
   I  #x                                       #  I
   I  # (0,0)                                  #  I
   I  # (MinimumXPosition,MinimumYPosition)    #  I
   I  #                                        #  I
   I  #                                        #  I
   I  #                                        #  I
   I  #                                        #  I
   I  #                                        #  I
   I  #                                        #  I
   I  #                                        #  I
   I  #     (MaximumXPosition,MaximumYPosition)#  I
   I  #                             (xmax,ymax)#  I
   I  #                                       x#  I
   I  ##########################################  I
   I                                              I
   ------------------------------------------------



  This mapping can be done by trial and error or by reading the raw
  output of the device (needs some serial port programming, see "The
  Linux Serial Programming HOWTO"). For the types EloTouch and
  MicroTouch exists a rudimentary calibration tool (written by the
  author of this document, it can be found at
  http://touchcal.sourceforge.net <http://touchcal.sourceforge.net>).

  2.  Activating the device

  After starting X, type in an Xterminal the command

  xsetpointer <devicename>

  where<devicename> is the name defined in XF86Config with the line
  DeviceName ".....", in this example it would be TouchScreen.

  To get the device working on startup use the AlwaysCore option in the
  touch screen section (see above)
  3.  Using touch screen and mouse in parallel

  To use the touch screen and a mouse in parallel you need to enter the
  mouse specs in the Xinput-section. This definitions should be the same
  as in the Pointer-section. The following example is for a PS/2-mouse:

  Section "Xinput"
     SubSection "Mouse"
        Protocol "PS/2"
        Port "/dev/mouse" #could also be /dev/psaux
        DeviceName "Mouse"
        AlwaysCore
     EndSubSection
  ...
  EndSection


  Several people pointed this out, especially the usage of the
  AlwaysCore option. Thanks to them all.

  4.  Configuration under XFree86 4

  (from Lee Monamy)

  Example XF86Config-4 for an ELO touch screen:


  Section "InputDevice"
          Identifier "ELO touchscreen"
          Driver "elographics"
          Option  "Device"        "/dev/ttyS0"
          Option  "MinimumXPosition"      "300"
          Option  "MaximumXPosition"      "3700"
          Option  "MinimumYPosition"      "300"
          Option  "MaximumYPosition"      "3700"
          Option  "UntouchDelay"  "10"
          Option  "ReportDelay"   "10"
          Option  "SendCoreEvents"        "yes"
  EndSection



  Noteable differences between this and the version 3 config are that
  you specify a Device, *not* a Port, otherwise you get an error.  Also,
  AlwaysCore from v3 has been replaced with SendCoreEvents.

  You must also add to the ServerLayout section, despite that X might
  say: "(II) XINPUT: Adding extended input device "TOUCHSCREEN" (type:
  Elographics Touch Screen)"


  Section "ServerLayout"
          Identifier      "Default Layout"
          Screen  "Default Screen"
          InputDevice "Generic Keyboard"
  ...
          InputDevice "ELO touchscreen"
  EndSection



  4.1.  Another configuration example

  from Dirk Mueller (for Microtouch SMT3 Series):


  Section "InputDevice"
          Identifier  "MicroTouchFinger"
          Driver      "mutouch"
          Option      "Type" "finger"
          Option      "Device" "/dev/ttyS0"
          Option      "ScreenNo" "0"
          Option      "MinimumXPosition" "0"
          Option      "MaximumXPosition" "16383"
          Option      "MinimumYPosition" "0"
          Option      "MaximumYPosition" "16383"
  EndSection



  Option "Type" can be "finger" or "stylus" Since Microtouch was bought
  by 3M-Touch, the resources are on
  http://www.3M.com/3MTouchSystems/downloads/legacy.jhtml#Linux
  <http://www.3M.com/3MTouchSystems/downloads/legacy.jhtml#Linux>

  4.2.  Addendum

  According to Wong Yeow Sen the configuration option names have changed
  in XFree86 4.2 (at least with Red Hat 7.3). If it seems your
  calibration values aren't parsed try the following:


  ...
          Option  "MinX"      "100"
          Option  "MaxX"      "4000"
          Option  "MinY"      "100"
          Option  "MaxY"      "4000"
  ...



  5.  Touch Screens on Fujitsu LifeBooks

  (from Joerg Hau)

  Information about these devices can be found here:

  "...

  Harald Hoyer's Linux Touch Panel Drivers for the Fujitsu Lifebooks
  B112/B142/B2130, http://parzelle.de/Linux/Lifebook/
  <http://parzelle.de/Linux/Lifebook/>. Unfortunately, this is XFree 3.x
  only and it seems that this information is now "static" (dead?).

  Kenan Esau's Lifebook Series B Touchscreen driver, which is the
  adaptation of Harald's driver to XFree 4.x.
  http://www.conan.de/lifebook/lifebook.html
  <http://www.conan.de/lifebook/lifebook.html>.

  I [Joerg Hau] have used Kenan's driver on my Fujitsu LifeBook B142
  (described at http://www.mysunrise.ch/users/joerg.hau/linux/b142.htm
  <http://www.mysunrise.ch/users/joerg.hau/linux/b142.htm>), and it
  works like a charm.

  6.  Configuration under X.Org

  (from Kenan Bektas)

  Example xorg.conf for an Elo TouchSystems 2216 AccuTouch® USB Touch-
  Monitor:
  Section "InputDevice"
      Identifier "elo"
      Driver "elo"
      Option "AlwaysCore"
      Option "MinX"          "300"
      Option "MaxX"          "3700"
      Option "MinY"          "300"
      Option "MaxY"          "3700"
      Option "ScreenNumber"  "0"
      Option "ButtonNumber"  "1"
  EndSection
