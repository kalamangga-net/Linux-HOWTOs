  Most X applications are written with the assumption that the user will
  be working with a 3 button mouse.  Serial mice are commonly used on
  computers and are cheap to buy.  Many of these mice have 3 buttons and
  claim to use the Microsoft protocol, which in theory means they are
  ideal for the X windows setup.  (The record for the cheapest working 3
  button mouse currently stands at $1.14!)


  Most dual-protocol mice will work in two modes:

  ·  2-button Microsoft mode.

  ·  3-button MouseSystems mode.

     This document leads you through the different steps needed to
     configure your mouse in these two different modes, especially the
     steps needed to use the more useful 3-button mode.


  As distributions become easier to set up, some of the problems ought
  to go away.  For instance, RedHat have a mouseconfig program to set
  things up for you.  However, some versions of RH5.0 had a bug in
  mouseconfig, so make sure you check for patches.


  3.  Serial Ports

  The first thing to do is to make sure the software can find the mouse.
  Work out which serial port your mouse is connected to - usually this
  will be /dev/ttyS0 (COM1 under DOS) or /dev/ttyS1 (COM2). (ttyS0 is
  usually the 9 pin socket, ttyS1 the 25 pin socket, but of course there
  is no hard and fast rule about these things.)  There are also an
  equivalent number of /dev/cua devices, which are almost the same as
  the ttyS ones, but their use is now discouraged.  For convenience make
  a new link /dev/mouse pointing at this port.  For instance, for ttyS0:


       ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/mouse



  4.  Switched Mice

  Some mice, not usually the cheapest ones, have a switch on the bottom
  marked `2/3'. Sometimes this may be `PC/MS'. In this case the `2'
  setting is for 2 button Microsoft mode, and the `3' for 3 button
  MouseSystems mode. The `PC/MS' switch is a bit more complicated.  You
  will probably find the `MS' setting is for Microsoft, and the `PC' is
  for MouseSystems. You may find the `PC' setting described as ps/2
  mode, but it should do MouseSystems as well.  If you have such a
  mouse, you can switch the switch to `3' or `PC', put the MouseSystems
  settings in your XConfigs (see below) and the mouse should work
  perfectly in 3-button mode.



  5.  Normal Mice

  If you don't have any switches, and no instructions, then a little bit
  of experimentation is needed.  The first thing to try is to assume the
  mouse maker is telling the truth, and the mouse is full Microsoft. Set
  up your Xconfigs to expect a Microsoft mouse (see the Xconfig section)
  and give it a try.


  If the mouse didn't work at all, then you don't have a Microsoft
  mouse, or there is some other problem. Try the other protocols in the
  configs, the man page for the config file is the best place to start
  looking. Also look in the Miscellaneous Problems section below.


  What you will probably find is that when you run X, the mouse works
  fine but only the outer two buttons do anything.  You can of course
  accept this, and emulate the third button (press both buttons at once
  to click the middle one) like you do with a two button mouse. To do
  this, change your Xconfig file as shown in the Xconfig example section
  below.  This may mean you have bought a 3 button mouse for no good
  reason, and you are certainly no further forward. So, now you need to
  look at your hardware.



  6.  Switching a Mouse to 3-Button Mode

  Even cheap mice can also work under the Mouse Systems protocol, with
  all three buttons working.  The trick is to get the mouse to think
  it's a Mouse Systems one, something you rarely see in your
  instructions.


  ·  Before you power up your computer, hold down the left mouse button
     (and keep it held down until it has booted to be on the safe side).

  When the mouse first gets power, if the left button is held down it
  switches into Mouse Systems mode. A simple fact, but not always
  publicised. Note that a soft reboot of your computer may not cut the
  mouse power and therefore may not work. There are a number of other
  ways of switching the mode, which may or may not work with your
  particular mouse. Some of these are less drastic than rebooting your
  computer, two are more so!


  ·  If your computer is get-at-able you can unplug the mouse and plug
     it back in with the button held down (although you shouldn't
     normally plug things in to a live computer, the RS232 spec says it
     is OK).

  ·  You may be able to reset the mouse by typing echo "*n" >
     /dev/mouse, which should have the same effect as unplugging it.
     Hold the left button down for Mouse Systems mode, not for
     Microsoft. You could put this in whatever script you use to start X
     up.

  ·  Bob Nichols (rnichols@interaccess.com) has written a small c
     program to do the same thing, which may work if echo "*n" does not
     (and vice versa). You can find a copy of his source code at
     http://kipper.york.ac.uk/src/fix-mouse.c

  ·  Someone has reported that the `ClearDTR' line in the Xconfig is
     enough to switch their mouse into Mouse Systems mode.

  ·  If you are brave enough, open the mouse up (remember that this will
     invalidate your warranty) and have a look inside. In some cases,
     the mouse may have a switch inside, for some strange reason known
     only to the manufacturer. More likely on the cheap mice is a jumper
     which you can move. The switch or jumper may have the same effect
     as a `MS/PC' switch described in the ``Switched Mice section''
     above.  You may find that the circuit board is designed for a
     switch between 2 & 3 buttons, but it hasn't been fitted. It will
     look something like:



           -----------
          | o | o | o |  SW1
           -----------
            1   2   3



  Try linking pins 1-2 or 2-3, and see if it changes the behaviour of
  the mouse.  If it does, you can either fit a small switch, or solder
  across the contacts for a quick and permanent solution.

  ·  Another soldering solution which might be a last-resort for mice
     which don't understand MouseSystems at all, from Peter Benie
     (pjb1008@chiark.chu.cam.ac.uk).  If the middle button's switch is
     double-pole, connect one side of the switch to the left button's
     switch, and the other side to right button's switch.  If it's not a
     double pole switch then use diodes rather than wire.  Now, the
     middle button pushes the left and right buttons down together.
     Select ChordMiddle in the XF86Config and you have a working middle
     button.

  ·  The ultimate recourse with the soldering iron was first described
     to me by Brian Craft (bcboy@pyramid.bio.brandeis.edu). Two common
     generic mouse chips are the 16 pin Z8350, and the 18 pin HM8350A.
     On each of these chips, one pin controls the mode of the chip, as
     follows.


       Pin 3   Mode
       -----   ----
       Open    Default Microsoft. Mouse Systems if a button is held on power-up.
       GND     Always Mouse Systems.
       Vdd     Always Microsoft.



  (Pins are numbered as follows:)


               ____
       pin1  -| \/ |-
       pin2  -|    |-
       pin3  -|    |-
             -|    |-
             -|    |-
             -|    |-
             -|    |-
       pin8  -|____|-



  (This info comes courtesy of Hans-Christoph Wirth, and Juergen Exner,
  who posted it to de.comp.os.linux.hardware)  You can solder a link
  between pin 3 and gnd, which will fix the mouse into MouseSystems
  mode.



  ·  Peter Fredriksson (peterf@lysator.liu.se) has tried the SYSGRATION
     SYS2005 chip, and found that linking Pin 3 to Gnd forced Mouse
     System mode.


  ·  Uli Drescher (ud@digi.ruhr.de) confirms it works on an HN8348A
     chip; Ben Ketcham (bketcham@anvilite.murkworks.net) confirms the
     HM8348A (Pin 9 is Gnd).

  ·  Urban Widmark (ubbe@ts.umu.se) says the same applies to the
     EC3567A1 chip, where Pin 8 is ground.  I've tried it as well and it
     works fine.

  ·  Timo T Metsala (metsala@cc.helsinki.fi) has found that on the
     HT6510A chip pin 3 is mode select, pin 9 is Gnd.  The same works
     for the HT6513A chip.  Holtek also make HT6513B and HT6513F chips -
     on these, pin 8 is Gnd.

  ·  Robert Romanowski (robin@cs.tu-berlin.de) says pin 3 - pin 8 (Gnd)
     works on an EM83701BP chip too.

  ·  Robert Kaiser (rkaiser@sysgo.de) confirms that pin 3 - Gnd works on
     a EC3576A1 chip too.

  ·  Sean Cross (secross@whidbey.com) found it was pin 2 - pin 7 (Gnd)
     on a HM8370GP chip.

  ·  Peter Fox (fox@roestock.demon.co.uk) used pin 3 - pin 8 on a
     HM8348A chip.

  ·  Jon Klein (jbklein@mindspring.com) found pin 3 - pin 9 did the
     trick for a UA5212S chip.

  ·  As an alternative to the above soldering methods, you can get the
     mouse to hold it's own button down when booting:  this circuit from
     Mathias Katzer.

           ---         \  C      |
           --- C        ------O----------> (to somewhere deep inside the mouse)
            |
           ###  Ground



  The test mouse was a no-name model MUS2S - whether this works in other
  mice depends on the circuit of the mouse; if the switch is connected
  to ground and not to +Supply, an npn-transistor like the BC547 should
  work; R and C have to be swapped then, too.

  So there you have it, the choice is yours. Stick with the default
  Microsoft two buttons, or work out how to switch the mode and set X up
  to take advantage of this.


  7.  Wheeled mice

  Mice with wheels have emerged in the last few years, starting with the
  Microsoft Intellimouse and spreading to other manufacturers.  The
  wheel can be clicked like a button, or rolled up and down.  Far and
  away the best reference for information is
  http://www.inria.fr/koala/colas/mouse-wheel-scroll/ which describes
  how to get lots of X applications to recognise the scrolling action.


  In general, you'll need a fairly new Xserver to use the scrolling
  action, but some older servers will recognise the clicking actions.
  For instance, the Intellimouse is supported by XFree 3.3.1 and later.


  8.  Using gpm to Switch Mouse Modes

  gpm is the program that lets you use the mouse in console mode.  It is
  usually included in linux distributions, and can be started from the
  command line or in the startup script /etc/rc.d/rc.local.  Note that
  distributions don't always have the most recent version (1.13 at time
  of writing) which can be found on mirrors of sunsite.unc.edu.


  The main modes for serial mice under gpm are:


       gpm -t ms
       gpm -t msc
       gpm -t help



  for Microsoft or MouseSystems modes, or to probe the mouse for you and
  tell you what it found.  To run gpm in MouseSystems mode, you may need
  a -3 flag, and possibly a DTR option, using the -o dtr flag:


       gpm -3 -o dtr -t msc


  gpm is often able to recognise all three buttons of the mouse even in
  Microsoft mode.  And newer versions (Version 1.0 and later (?))  can
  then make this information available to other programs.  For this to
  work, you need to run gpm with the -R tag, like this:

       gpm -R -t ms


  This will make gpm re-export the mouse data to a new device, called
  /dev/gpmdata, which looks like a mouse to any other program.  Note
  that this device always uses the MouseSystems protocol.  You can then
  set your Xconfig to use this instead of /dev/mouse as shown below, but
  of course you must ensure gpm is always running when you use X.  Some
  people have reported that some middle-button events are not correctly
  interpreted by X using this technique, this may be down to an individ­
  ual mouse setup.



  Changing button mapping for gpm and X (gustafso@math.utah.edu)



  You may find that gpm uses different default button mappings to X, so
  using both systems on the same machine can be confusing.  To make X
  use the same buttons for select and paste operations as gpm, use the X
  command


       xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 3 2"


  which causes the left button to select and the right button to paste,
  for either 2-button or 3-button mice.  To force gpm to use the X stan­
  dard button mapping, start it with a -B command, eg:

       gpm -t msc -B 132



  9.  Using two mice

  In some cases, for instance a laptop with a built-in pointing device,
  you may wish to use a serial mouse as a second device.  In most cases
  the built-in device uses the PS/2 protocol, and can be ignored if you
  don't wish to use it.  Simply configure gpm or X to use /dev/ttyS0 (or
  whatever) as usual.


  To use both at once, you can use gpm -M to re-export the devices.
  More details in the gpm man page.  Also, XFree 3.3.1 and later support
  muliple input devices, using the XInput mechanism.  Auto-generated
  XF86Config files should have the necessary comments in them.



  10.  XF86Config and Xconfig file examples

  The location of your configuration file for X depends on the
  particular release and distribution you have. It will probably be
  either /etc/Xconfig, /etc/XF86Config or /usr/X11/lib/X11/XF86Config.
  You should see which one it is when you start X - it will be echoed to
  the screen before all the options are displayed. The syntax is
  slightly different between the XF86Config and Xconfig files, so both
  are given.


  Microsoft Serial Mouse


  ·  XF86config:


       Section "Pointer"
           Protocol "microsoft"
           Device "/dev/mouse"
       EndSection



  ·  Xconfig:


       #
       # Mouse definition and related parameters
       #
       Microsoft      "/dev/mouse"



  Microsoft Serial Mouse with Three Button Emulation


  ·  XF86config:


       Section "Pointer"
           Protocol "microsoft"
           Device "/dev/mouse"
           Emulate3Buttons
       EndSection



  ·  Xconfig:


       #

       #
       Microsoft      "/dev/mouse"

       ClearDTR                #  These two lines probably won't be needed,
       ClearRTS                #  try without first and then just the DTR



  Microsoft Serial Mouse with gpm -R


  ·  XF86config:



  Section "Pointer"
      Protocol "MouseSystems"
      Device "/dev/gpmdata"
  EndSection



  ·  Xconfig:


       #
       # Mouse definition and related parameters
       #
       MouseSystems      "/dev/gpmdata"



  11.  Cables, extensions and adaptors

  The only wires needed in a mouse cable are as follows: TxD and RxD for
  data transfer, RTS and/or DTR for power sources, and ground.
  Translated into pin numbers, they are:


                   9-pin port     25-pin port
               TxD     3                2
               RxD     2                3
               RTS     7                4
               DTR     4               20
               Gnd     5                7



  The above table may be of use if you wish to make adaptors between 9-
  and 25-pin plugs, or extension cables.



  12.  Miscellaneous Problems and Setups


  ·  If you have trouble with your mouse in X or console mode, check you
     are not running a getty on the serial line, or anything else such
     as a modem for that matter. Also check for IRQ conflicts.

  ·  It is possible that you need to hold down the left button when
     booting X windows.  Some systems may send some sort of signal or
     spike to the mouse when X starts.

  ·  Problems with serial devices may be due to the serial port not
     being initialised correctly at boot. This is done by the setserial
     command, run from the start-up script /etc/rc.d/rc.serial. Check
     the man page for setserial and the Serial-HOWTO for more details.
     It may be worth a little experimentation with types, for instance
     try setserial /dev/mouse uart 16550 or 16550a regardless of what
     port you actually have.  (For instance, mice don't like the
     16c550AF).

  ·  The ClearDTR flag may not work properly on some systems, unless you
     disable the RTS/CTS handshaking with the command:


  stty -crtscts < /dev/mouse


  (Tested on UART 16450/Pentium by Vladimir Geogjaev geog­
  jaev@wave.sio.rssi.ru)

  ·  Logitech mice may require the line ChordMiddle to enable the middle
     of the three buttons to work. This line replaces Emulate3Buttons or
     goes after the /dev/mouse line in the config file. You may well
     need the ClearDTR and ClearRTS lines in your Xconfig.  Some
     Logitech mice positively do not need the ChordMiddle line - one
     symptom of this problem is that menus seem to move with the mouse
     instead of scrolling down. (From: chang@platform.com)

  ·  Swapping buttons: use the xmodmap command to change which physical
     button registers as each mouse click. eg:  xmodmap -e "pointer = 3
     2 1"  will turn round the buttons for use in the left hand. If you
     only have a two-button mouse then it's just numbers 1 & 2.

  ·  Acceleration: use the xset m command to change the mouse settings.
     eg xset m 2  will set the acceleration to 2. Look at the manpage
     for full details.

  ·  Pointer offset: If the click action appears to be coming from the
     left or right of where the cursor is, it may be that your screen is
     not aligned. This is a problem with the S3 driver, which you may be
     able to fix using xvidtune. Try Invert_VCLK/InvertVCLK, or EarlySC.
     This info from Bill Lavender (lavender@MCS.COM) and Simon Hargrave.
     In the XF86Config, it might look like this:



       Subsection "Display"
           Modes       "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "1280x1024"
           Invert_VCLK "*" 1
           ...



  ·  If you are getting `bouncing' of the mouse buttons, ie two clicks
     when you only wanted one, there may be something wrong with the
     mouse.  This problem has been solved for Logitech mice by Bob
     Nichols (rnichols@interaccess.com) and involves soldering some
     resistors and a chip in the mouse to debounce the microswitches.

  ·  If some users cannot get the mouse to work but some (eg root) can,
     it is possible that the users are not running exactly the same
     thing - for instance a different version of X or a different
     Xconfig.  Check the X start-up messages carefully to make sure.

  ·  If you find the mouse pointer is erasing things from your screen,
     you have a server config problem.  Try adding the option linear, or
     maybe nolinear to the graphics card section, or if it is a PCI
     board, the options tgui_pci_write_off and tgui_pci_read_off.  (This
     seems to be a Trident Card problem.)

  ·  If the mouse cursor doesn't show up on the screen, but otherwise
     seems to be working, try the option "sw_cursor" in the Device
     section of the config file.

  ·  If your mouse stops working when its sunny or when you turn a light
     on, it may be that the sensors are being swamped by light getting
     through the case.  You could try painting the inside of the case
     black, or putting some card in the top.

  ·  Microsoft Brand mice are often a cause of problems. The newest
     ``Microsoft Serial Mouse 2.1A'' has been reported not to work on
     many systems, although unplugging it and plugging it in again may
     help.  gpm version 1.13 and higher should also support 2.1A mice,
     using the pnp mouse type.  (See the gpm section for how to re-
     export this.)  The ``Microsoft Intellimouse'' also causes problems,
     although it should now be supported by XFree version 3.3 and later.


  13.  Models Tested

  There are a lot of different mice out there, and I cannot honestly say
  that you should go out and buy one rather than the other. What I can
  do is give a list of what I think these mice do, based on experience
  and heresay.  Even with this information you should be a little
  cautious - we had two identical mice in our office on two computers,
  some things worked on one and not t'other!  Any additions to this list
  would be welcome.

  15.  Mouse Tail

  Much of the information for this document has been trawled from the
  various linux newsgroups. I am sorry I did not keep a record of
  everyone who has indirectly contributed by this route, thank you all
  very much.


  So, to sum up:


  ·  Even cheap 3 button Microsoft mice can be made to work.

  ·  Configure your copy of X to expect a Mouse Systems mouse.

  ·  Hold down the left button at power-on to switch the mouse to
     MouseSystems mode.

  ·  You might need to hold the left button down when starting X.

  ·  Mice are more intelligent than you think.
