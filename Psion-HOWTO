  1.  About this HOWTO



  1.1.  Introduction


  Psion <http://www.Psion.com/> has been making PDA's for years. This
  document will concentrate on the Series 5* models, e.g. Series 5,
  Series 5mx <http://www.series5mx.com/> and Series 5mx PRO and the 32
  bit EPOC operating system they come with, but there will be some
  crossover to older models such as the Series 3* and newer models such
  as the Series 7. There is also a little information about other
  ``series'' at the end of this document.


  1.2.  This Document


  The latest version of this document can be found at
  <http://home.pages.de/~lufthans/unix/docs/HOWTO/psion-HOWTO.html>, but
  the main repository is the Linux Documentation Project (LDP
  <http://www.LinuxDoc.org/>).

  Please send updates, corrections or suggestions to psion@LuftHans.com.


  1.3.  Mailing List


  There is a mailing list dedicated to using Psions with Linux and
  developing tools to enhance communication between them.

  To subscribe, send a message to plptools-developers-
  request@lists.SourceForge.net. John Schrader has put up a searchable
  list <http://rz-home.de/~jschrade/linux-psion.html> of messages from
  Oct 1998 through Feb 1999.

  There is also a mailing list dedicated to porting Linux to the Psion
  5* models at linux-7110-request@lists.SourceForge.net. An archive
  beginning 04Dec1999 is available at
  <http://web.gnu.walfield.org/mail-archive/linux-7110/>.

  Both mailing lists can be searched through the SourceForge interface.

  2.  General Information



  2.1.  What is a Psion


  Psion is a powerful Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) with pen-based
  touch screen as well as keyboard. There are several models. This HOWTO
  currently only covers the Series 5* models, e.g. Series 5, Series 5mx
  and Series 5mxPro.



  2.2.  Psion models


  There are several models of Psion PDAs. All have a foldout case where
  the screen is in the cover and opening the Psion causes the keyboard
  to jut out to a more usable position. They also feature the instant on
  and instant off capabilities of the EPOC operating system.

  Psion 3* are older PDAs that still have a lot of functionality and
  still get sold new due to their meeting needs and being lower cost.
  This HOWTO doesn't currently cover the Psion 3* series.

  Psion 5* has two main product lines with each having two models. The
  Psion series 5 has a green limited edition counterpart with no
  functional difference between itself and the standard Series 5. The
  series 5mxPro, however, has some fundamental differences from the
  Series 5mx.

  All four of the Series 5* products have: compact flash, serial port,
  keyboard and stylus (for the touchscreen). They all operate on 2 AA
  batteries and have a backup battery to maintain state when changing
  out the main batteries. Check out Akaev's site
  <http://psion.by.ru/psioninside/s5inside/index.htm> to take a tour of
  a dissected Series 5 classic.

  Both of the Series 5 models as well as the Series 5mx have system ROMs
  where the EPOC operating system is stored. After boot they operate out
  of the RAM (8MB for the Series 5 models and 16MB for the Series 5mx).
  The Series 5mxPro, however, has no ROM and operates entirely out of
  its 24MB of RAM. This enables software upgrades to the Series 5mxPro,
  whereas the other 3 models must exchange hardware to update EPOC.

  Psion has also released the Series 7, which is set to compete against
  the subnotebook class of PC, but running EPOC. They also have a Revo,
  which is smaller than the Series 5*.


  2.3.  Psion Availability


  Psion products are no longer available at retail stores in the US.
  They are available from retail shops in Europe as well as through mail
  order. Psion maintains a list of mail order
  <http://www.psion.com/resellers/index.html> firms by country on their
  web site.

  3.  Sharing data between the Psion and Linux



  3.1.  Hardware connectivity options


  The Psions have both serial and infra red ports. Either can be used
  for connectivity, but most connectivity programs currently only have
  features for the serial port connection.


  3.1.1.  Serial cable


  Armin Podtschaske x-rayed the "honda" connector.


  Pin 1 is on the top and pin 15 is on the bottom. Only pins 2 through 8
  and 15 are connected.


  ·  Pin 2: RTS

  ·  Pin 3: DTR

  ·  Pin 4: TXD

  ·  Pin 5: DSR

  ·  Pin 6: DCD

  ·  Pin 7: CTS

  ·  Pin 8: RXD

  ·  Pin 15: GND - Signal and Power ground

  ·  Frame: GND - Shield frame ground


  3.1.2.  IrDA


  See Werner Heuser's Infrared HOWTO
  <http://www.LinuxDoc.org/HOWTO/Infrared-HOWTO/> for information about
  using the Linux IrDA driver with a Psion. It is possible to beam files
  from Psion 5 (mx) via Linux-IrDA to a Linux System. The irda-utils
  include a special client psion5.c which can beam files between them.


  3.1.3.  Builtin programs


  There are two builtin software methods to use the communications
  ports. The first is the remote link, <ctrl>-l from the main file menu,
  which can be set to serial, infrared or off.

  EPOC also provides the program comms. The remote link must be set to
  off for the comms program to have access to the serial port.


  3.2.  Programs for connectivity



  3.2.1.  plptools



     Description
        plptools <http://SourceForge.net/projects/plptools> was
        originally developed by Fritz Elfert, who had merged plp and
        ``p3nfs/p5nfs''. plptools is currently being worked on by
        members of the PLP Tools project.

        plptools comprises of 3 different programs. ncpd provides a
        socket connection to the Psion. plpnfsd provides mounted
        filesystem access to the Psion and plpftp provides ftp access to
        the Psion.



     Usage
        ncpd [-V] [-v logclass] [-d] [-p <port>] [-s <device>] [-b
        <baudrate>]

        plpnfsd [-v] [-V] [-p port] [-d mountdir] [-u user]

        First start ncpd get it to listen on a port (7501 by default)
        for connection requests. Then, start either plpnfsd or plpftp.
        plpnfsd defaults to mount the Psion under /mnt/psion.



  3.2.2.  p3nfs/p5nfs



     Description

        p3nfs <http://www.koeniglich.de/> mounts the psion drives over
        the serial cable at /psion.stand/mnt, by default.



  3.2.3.  ncp



     Description
        Matt Gumbley originally started ncp
        <http://www.gumbley.demon.co.uk/ncp.html> for use with his Psion
        Series 3. Now that he's working on ``plptools'', you should use
        that :). However, ncp might still be of interest to users of a
        Psion Series 3, which this HOWTO doesn't cover :). Matt's ncp
        page also has information about the plp protocol.



  3.3.  Linux utilities

        translate Sketch files and MBM files to almost any graphics
        format. A description of the Psion files formats is also
        included.
