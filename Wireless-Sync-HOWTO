This document explains how to perform a wireless, network sync between a 
Handspring Visor and jpilot or jpilot-sync. Although this concentrates on
specific hardware, the techniques and information should translate to all
similar devices.

This procedure has been tested on the Handspring Visor Deluxe. It should work
on all PalmOS based devices as well.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction

I had just acquired my 802.11b module for my Visor, and decided that I wanted
to do away with the need for the cradle that would keep me locked to a
desktop for syncing purposes. After all, the whole point of being wireless
and handheld was to be mobile. After many hours of careful reading in
entirely too many sources, I have distilled the necessary information into
this short HOWTO. If at anytime you find yourself going through the HOWTO and
have to stop and lookup how to do something I have listed, please email that
to me so I can add it and help the next person who reads this.

Also, please send me reports of success (and failures) of hardware devices
other than those listed so that I may append it to this document.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Components Used & Required Software

2.1. The Hardware components used for this document are:

  * Visor Handheld Deluxe
   
  * Xircom SpringPort Wireless Ethernet Module
   
  * EZ Connect 11 Mbps Wireless Access Point
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Software required and version used

  * RedHat 7.2
   
  * jpilot-0.99.1pre with patch to correct jpilot-sync
   
  * pilot-link 0.9.5-pre3
   
  * PalmOS v. 3.1H2
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Setup

3.1. Visor

3.1.1. Configure a new service to use for syncing.

Click Prefs on the Visor. In the upper right-hand corner is a drop down menu.
Click and select Network. Click the main drop down menu by clicking the drop
down icon in the lower left corner of the visor, next to the graffiti screen.
From the menu that drops down, click New and configure a new serverice
according to the following.

  * Username
   
    The username used to log onto the network.
   
  * Password
   
    The username used to log onto the network.
   
  * Phone Number 00
   
    This will tell the Visor to use a network connection.
   
  * Connection Type PPP
   
  * Query DNS should be checked
   
  * IP Address
   
    Automatic should be checked if DHCP is running.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.2. Configure your Primary PC Setup to the workstation that will be
running jpilot.

  * Primary PC Name
   
    This is the full network name of the workstation.
   
  * Primary PC Address
   
    The IP of the workstation. If using DHCP, it is a good idea to map the
    number to the MAC address of the NIC so the it will remain constant. This
    will save you from having to re-enter this info.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2. SpringPort Module

3.2.1. Configure Client Settings

  * Client Name
   
    Set to whatever you wish. This will be the name that the Visor announces
    to the network as it's own.
   
  * Profile
   
    The Xircom module supports 3 separate setups. Select one for use in your
    system.
   
  * Network ID (SSID)
   
    For maximum security, this should be a unique name shared among all the
    802.11b devices that are attached to your network.
   
  * Encryption
   
    For maximum security, this should be enabled and set to the highest
    available that is supported by all the devices. Use the WAP to create the
    key to install to all the 802.11b devices that are attached to your
    network.
   
  * MAC Address
   
    Enter this into the MAC allowed list and re-enable MAC filtering.
   

Tip Obtaining the MAC address on the Xircom Wireless Ethernet Module         
    The MAC address should be printed on the label that is sandwiched between
    the Visor and the module. If that is unreadable, it will have to be found
    out another way. The easiest way I have found to do this is to disable   
    MAC filtering on the WAP, configure the above and connect. Clicking      
    Status/IP Information will bring up a screen showing the MAC of the      
    module.                                                                  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.2. Configure Network Settings

This is handled by the "Configure New Service" section above.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.3. Configure HotSync Settings

This is handled by the "Configure New Service" section above.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.4. Wireless Access Point

Setup your access point according to your manufacturer's directions. The
following services are recommended:

  * 128bit Encryption
   
  * MAC Filtering
   
  * Unique SSID enabled
   
  * DHCP - Either from network or Access Point, but not both.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3. Software Configuration

3.3.1. jpilot

Run jpilot and set the following under File/Preferences/Settings.

  * Serial Port .
   
    For clarity, the setting is a single period. This will signify to
    underlying pilot-link subsystem to expect a network connection.
   
  * Serial Rate
   
    This can be put to the hightest setting.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.2. jpilot-sync

To configure jpilot-sync, configure jpilot as describe above, then exit.

Next, use the following command to run in a daemon-like mode.
        jpilot-sync -l >& /dev/null &                                        

Warning Do not attempt to sync using jpilot while jpilot-sync is running by  
        pressing Sync in jpilot. This may or may not work the first time, but
        will certainly crash both at the completion.                         

Note You can run jpilot while jpilot-sync is running, and even edit/add      
     entries or sync. Simply allow jpilot-sync to run in the background to   
     pick up the sync request.                                               

Alternatively, for a pure command-line approach, edit the jpilot.rc file and
change port to .. and rate to 10.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Operation

With all the above configured correctly, operation is quite simple. Click 
HotSync icon on the Visor, then click ModemSync. Allow the client to
negotiate a connection with the network, then click Sync on jpilot.
