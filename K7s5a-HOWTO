  How to use Elite's K7s5a mainboard under GNU/Linux.

  1.  Introduction


  1.1.  History

  I got the mainboard for Christmas 2001, and after a little while, I
  understood that the new chipset sis735 was not handled by Mandrake
  <http://www.mandrake.com> 8.0, OSS <http://www.opensound.com> had
  drivers for it that worked but I didn't really want to pay for it, so
  I looked on ALSA cvs and found that in their latest sources they had
  something for the sis 7012, and a bit later I found the drivers for
  the sensors.

  It has now been 3 years I started this howto and I am always glad to
  get comments, advices from everywhere in the world :]

  2.1.  ALSA versus the AC'97 Driver

  I have used both solutions successfully. However I noticed while
  working on a speech synthesis system (I was involved in a small
  accessibility project), that the kernel driver does not seem to be
  able to re-sample, whereas Alsa does it perfectly.


  2.2.  Alsa

  2.2.1.  Getting the ALSA drivers

  So we will be compiling the latest sources from ALSA, which should
  work for all other distributions as well... only the kernel sources
  will change because mandrake uses specific patches.

  You may get your kernel sources from your distribution or from
  http://www.kernel.org <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/>

  Here can be found Mandrake sources for the kernel used in 8.0:

  ftp://ftp.univ-
  savoie.fr/pub/Linux/Mandrake/8.0/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/kernel
  -source-2.4.3-20mdk.i586.rpm <ftp://ftp.univ-
  savoie.fr/pub/Linux/Mandrake/8.0/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/kernel-
  source-2.4.3-20mdk.i586.rpm>
  (link seems to be broken, I wish I had made a copy if someone needed
  but here is the problem with that distribution, mirrors are not kept
  long enough)

  and grab the tarball from ALSA:

  ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/driver/alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10.tar.bz2
  <ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/driver/alsa-
  driver-0.9.0beta10.tar.bz2>


  2.2.2.  Installation

  Install your kernel sources, in my case:

  rpm -ivh kernel-source-2.4.3-20mdk.i586.rpm

  Then decompress alsa drivers:

  bzip2 -d alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10.tar.bz2 && tar -xvf alsa-
  driver-0.9.0beta10.tar

  Make them and install them and create the devices files:

  cd alsa-driver-0.9.0beta10 && make install && ./snddevices

  Edit /etc/modules.conf to set everything, and add to it the following
  lines:



       alias char-major-116 snd
       alias char-major-14 soundcore
       alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0
       alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
       alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
       alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
       alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
       alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss
       alias snd-card-0 snd-card-intel8x0



  warning: Christian Cardinale rf.libertysurf@elanidrac.naitsirhc
  reports that he had to change 'snd-card-intel8x0' for 'snd-intel8x0',
  which corresponds to what I have for my Debian system, I no longer
  remember, but I think this one is the mandrake name, if it doesn't
  work, just use to the other, ok?


  2.3.  Alsa the Debian way

  I've switched to Debian some time after writing this howto and wanted
  to give some instructions about it: Things may change a little
  depending on which version you're using, I use Debian sarge, currently
  the testing version.


  2.3.1.  Using a Debian package with a precompiled kernel

  First of all, you can directly download the appropriate precompiled
  alsa modules: find out which kernel you're using

  uname -r

  2.4.20-3-k7     (should be 2.4.18-k7 or something like that for a
  woody/stable)

  apt-get install alsa-modules-2.4.20-3-k7

  the card is the "intel8x0 (PCI: Intel i810/i820/i830/i840/MX440
  integrated audio)"

  you should also install the recommended package alsa-utils

  apt-get install alsa-utils

  now, check the file /etc/alsa/modutils/0.9 against the one given
  further on this howto.  It may also be necessary to run update-modules
  as root to ensure that these lines get into /etc/modules.conf,
  although the package installation probably does it itself.


  2.3.2.  Using a Debian kernel source package

  I was forced to recompile my kernel when I got an usb adsl modem.
  (make-kpkg binary --initrd is something you want to look at someday,
  but it's off topic)

  I'm assuming, you've done at least the following steps:

  install the alsa sources and two useful packages: apt-get install
  alsa-source alsa-utils alsa-base debconf will ask you the following
  questions:



       Say Yes if you want to build ALSA driver with ISA PnP version.
       If your computer doesn't support ISA PnP, you may say No.
       Build ALSA driver with ISA PnP?



  You can safely select 'no'



       Say Yes if you want to build ALSA driver with debugging code.
       Build ALSA driver with debugging code?



  We don't need that either, so select 'no'



       You can choose cards to be built by selecting cards you want.
       Each selection is a same name to a option of configure script '--with-cards'.
       The following list are short descriptions of the options to show what they mean.
       Select cards to be built.



  Select card intel8x0 (PCI: Intel i810/i820/i830/i840/MX440 integrated
  audio) and exit.


  cd /usr/src

  tar xzvf alsa-driver.tar.gz

  cd modules/alsa-driver

  ./configure

  make && make install

  now, check the file /etc/alsa/modutils/0.9 against this following one.


  2.3.3.  /etc/alsa/modutils/0.9

  I only remember changing the cards_limit from 4 to 1, to prevent
  warnings, any modification of it should be followed by running update-
  modules in order to regenerate /etc/modules.conf



       ### DEBCONF MAGIC
       # This file was automatically generated by alsa-base's debconf stuff

       alias char-major-116 snd
       alias char-major-14 soundcore
       alias snd-card-0 snd-intel8x0
       alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0
       options snd major=116 cards_limit=1 device_mode=0660 device_gid=29 device_uid=0

       alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
       alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
       alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
       alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
       alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss



  2.4.  Kernel Approach: The AC'97 Driver

  If you are using a 2.4 or later kernel you can use the Audio Codec
  '97 (AC'97) <http://developer.intel.com/ial/scalableplatforms/audio/>
  sound driver, as the integrated sound card is AC'97 complaint.

  You may enable your soundcard with a kernel module, as a matter of
  fact, you should be able to just use the module without even
  recompiling your kernel, because most GNU/Linux distributions have it
  already, just type:

  modprobe i810_audio

  and you should see something like this in your syslog:



         Intel 810 + AC97 Audio, version 0.21, 21:31:04 Apr 15 2002
         i810: SiS 7012 found at IO 0xd800 and 0xdc00, IRQ 11
         i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 2 channels.
         ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x414c:0x4710 (ALC200/200P)
         i810_audio: AC'97 codec 0 supports AMAP, total channels = 2



  or type

  dmesg | less and scroll to see the kernel messages.

  If everything went fine, you may add i810_audio to /etc/modules so it
  will autoload everytime you boot:

  echo "i810_audio" >> /etc/modules


  or you like monolitic kernels (no modules), follow the step above to
  install the kernel sources and say Y to Sound card support and Y to
  Intel ICH (i8xx) audio support compile your kernel, install, reboot
  and now your integrated soundcard is working.

  If you don't know how to compile a kernel, read the Kernel HOWTO
  <http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html>, it's easy and you'll
  get a optimized kernel for you system, also you'll learn a bit about
  that talk of using the source code (yes you are already taking
  advantage of it :-)


  3.  The mainboard's sensors


  3.1.  lm-sensors

  3.1.1.  Getting the drivers

  Get the lm_sensors 2.6.2 or more recent: http://www.lm-
  sensors.nu/archive/lm_sensors-2.6.2.tar.gz <http://www.lm-
  sensors.nu/archive/lm_sensors-2.6.2.tar.gz> You'll need kernel sources
  too in order to compile that one.

  3.1.2.  Installing them

  tar -xzvf i2c-2.6.2.tar.gz

  cd i2c-2.6.2

  make && make install

  Then there was a problem when making install for me, so if it doesn't
  work, just do the following:

  cp kernel/i2c-core.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc/i2c-core.o

  cp kernel/i2c-proc.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc/i2c-proc.o

  Now let's copy the specific driver:

  cp kernel/chips/it87.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc/it87.o

  ok now

  cp prog/sensors/sensors /usr/bin/sensors

  --------------------------------------------------------------------


  Edit /etc/modules.conf and add to it the following lines:



  alias char-major-89 i2c-dev
  options it87 temp_type=0x31



  now:

  modprobe i2c-proc

  modprobe it87

  modprobe i2c-isa

  sensors

  should output you some data

  When it works, you can write it to a file, that will be loaded
  automatically on boot. Under SuSE <http://www.SuSE.de> the file is:
  /etc/init.d/boot.local (used to be /sbin/init.d/) and you should just
  add: sensors -s Under mandrake, the install should have created that
  file: /etc/init.d/sensors, which you can edit freely, sensord being
  just a daemon to watch over temperature and fan speed, I assume no one
  will need something like that for her/his own machine.

  Paolo reports that in order to start up sensord on boot, he put in
  /etc/sysconfig/sensors:


       MODULE_0=i2c-proc
       MODULE_1=it87
       MODULE_2=i2c-isa



  Now as root you should edit your /etc/sensors.conf search for that
  line: chip "it87-*" and below you should be able to modify everything
  to get the right data, here is a copy of what i have in there: (please
  note that temp1 is trash and only temp2 and temp3 should be kept)

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.2.  lm-sensors the Debian way

  This time you'll be forced to compile the modules.  install the source
  and programs:

  apt-get install lm-sensors lm-sensors-source



        The upstream lm-sensors maintainers know of a problem using
        lm-sensors with IBM ThinkPad computers, resulting in
        firmware corruption.  If you are installing this package on
        a ThinkPad, you should wait until the upstream maintainers
        have solved this problem before building modules from it.
        For more information, see
        /usr/share/doc/lm-sensors-source/README.thinkpad.
        IBM ThinkPad brokenness -- really install lm-sensors?



  Answer yes to this question, you can't have an IBM thinkpad and the
  k7s5a in the same box as far as I know!

  cd /usr/src

  tar xzvf lm-sensors.tar.gz

  cd modules/lm-sensors/

  make && make install

  Then you should have modutils take a few arguments, the best way is
  probably to use a new file, like: /etc/modutils/sensors with this
  content:



       alias char-major-89 i2c-dev
       options it87 temp_type=0x31



  run

  update-modules

  modprobe i2c-isa it87

  You can now type sensors to access to the informations (note that you
  should edit sensors.conf, otherwise you'll see strange and inaccurate
  things :] )

  You can also put i2c-isa and it87 in /etc/modules (one by line!) to
  have them be automatically loaded on boot, I don't know yet,
  how/whether it is possible to use some automatic loading/removing
  process with /etc/modules.conf


  3.3.  Sensors.conf for the K7s5a

          CONFIG_ISA=y
          # I2C support
          CONFIG_I2C=m

          # I2C Hardware Sensors Chip support
          CONFIG_I2C_SENSOR=m
          CONFIG_SENSORS_IT87=m



  3.4.2.  Setting up the modules

  mount sysfs pseudo filesystem if you have not done it yet.

  mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys

  See Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.txt and Documentation/i2c/sysfs-
  interface in the kernel sources tree

  modprobe it87

  modprobe i2c-isa Sensors can be accessed in the sysfs pseudo file
  system. But if you want you can use the lm_sensors user tools...



  3.4.3.  The lm_sensors user tools

  Install sensors user tools:

  cd lm_sensors-2.8.3

  copy this into a file named chips-it87.diff

  NOTE: This patch is only required for old versions of lm_sensors,

  4.  The mainboard's LAN adapter

  4.1.  Making it work...

  If your board came with the optional on-board LAN card, you have a
  Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] SiS900 10/100 Fast Ethernet card,
  this card is supported by Linux kernels 2.4 and later (that I know of,
  as I only use 2.4 kernels).


  To make it work you should type

  modprobe sis900


  and you should see something like this in your syslog:



         sis900.c: v1.08.02 11/30/2001
         eth0: SiS 900 PCI Fast Ethernet at 0xd400, IRQ 5, 00:d0:09:ea:7a:98.



  or type

  dmesg | less and scroll to see the kernel messages.

  If everything went fine, you may add sis900 to /etc/modules so it will
  autoload everytime you boot:

  echo "sis900" >> /etc/modules

  (or echo "alias eth0 sis900" >> /etc/modutils/aliases && update-
  modules for the module to be loaded when needed, go for that if you
  have a Debian system)

  Pay attention to the double >, or you will have troubles :]

  or compile it in your kernel, where you should say Y to SiS 900/7016
  PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter support in your kernel configuration.



  5.  Other

  5.1.  Knoppix

  Yesterday (8/28/2003), I tried to boot with a Knoppix cd (3.2) and
  found out that the computer froze during the SCSI probes.
  I encountered the same problem with a more recent version (3.3).

  Here is a quick way to prevent this:

  When you get the knoppix prompt, add noscsi and your lang settings and
  press enter:



       boot: knoppix noscsi lang=fr



  lang=fr is only to ensure that my language will be used even though I
  overrode the append line.



  5.2.  Notes about parallel port networking (PLIP) and floppy bus


  I recently found out several important hardware flaws on this
  mainboard.  For example I could not get PLIP to work properly, if
  anyone has, let me know!  I used a grey laplink parallel cable (also
  known as Null Printer Cable)  a friend sold me and followed the PLIP
  Howto <http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/PLIP.html>. I could watch activity on
  the pins using a dos tool, but nothing went through, it even gave a
  warning:

  modprobe plip

  tail /var/log/messages



       kernel: plip: parport0 has no IRQ. Using IRQ-less mode,which is fairly inefficient!
       kernel: NET3 PLIP version 2.4-parport pj.oc.irm@ebiing
       kernel: plip0: Parallel port at 0x378, not using IRQ.



  Karl said:

  "I've found there is only one parallel port mode which actually
  assigns an IRQ in real life (the bios believes differently) I think
  its EPP but i could be wrong. I haven't used PLIP before but i thought
  that this may help a little."

  I still get the same warning, let me know if it ever worked.

  So I had to go on with floppies, since the box didn't have a cdrom
  drive, and there, I found out that the 486 had a much faster writing
  speed, more than 10 seconds of difference writing exactly the same
  image to the the same floppy...


  5.3.  Notes about mainboard replacement

  Contribution of DR hab. Janusz S. Bien

       > principle this is still ECS K7S5A, but seems to have a different sound

       I have now (with kernel 2.4.27, see below):

       Jan 31 10:51:47 galicja kernel: i810: SiS 7012 found at IO 0xd800 and 0xdc0=

       [...]
       Jan 31 10:51:47 galicja kernel: ac97_codec: AC97  codec, id: CMI65 (CMedia)

       Earlier it was

       Nov 23 06:42:36 galicja kernel: i810: SiS 7012 found at IO 0xd800 and 0xdc0=
       0, MEM 0x0000 and 0x0000, IRQ 11

       I just upgraded the kernel to 2.4.27 and situation is now worse: I
       have no sound in xawtv, too.



  If you have a similar situation, please have a look at the Alsa
  drivers.

  5.6.  Some words (About BIOS)

  5.6.1.  Alvaro

  Using a modified BIOS, I was able to successfully overclock my Athlon
  1000Mhz to 1050Mhz flawlessy, but when I messed with hdparm (30Gig
  Western Digital hard drive) using hdparm -c1 -X66 /dev/hda, I managed
  to corrupt my filesystem, so beware.


  If you are a real tweaker, you might want to change your BIOS Logo and
  stuff, some people tried that and it worked OK, some others not, so
  they had to flash their BIOS again (blindly with a bootdisk and a
  working bios in it) to make the board work again. It is really up to
  you. Search Google or OC Workbench and you'll be on your way.


  Good Luck! :-)

  5.6.2.  Karl

  "Also i recommend you try using either the HoneyX bios or the
  CHEEPOman bios for the k7s5a instead of the official release, it gives
  you more control although some problems with non-atapi CD drives (my
  dvd goes crazy in linux with cheepoman)

  The cheepoman bios also fixes several issues which ECS has still not
  attended to.

  These bios roms are unsupported by ECS please bare that in mind, also
  they are meant for overclocking more than anything else, overclocking
  in such a way as you don't need a pencil ;)"
