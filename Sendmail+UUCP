  History:

     Initial edition July/96: works only with non-bind edition of
   sendmail

     Oct 01 /96: works with the redhat supplied binary

     Oct 07 /96: added/modified a tip on how to compile non-bind sendmail

     Oct 25 /96: added/modified a tip on how to keep sendmail
   getHostbyAddr() happy via a dummy /etc/hosts entry

     Mar 15 /97: I am amazed at the response/feedback i am receiving so i
   decided to refine this further. Fixed some small errors; added diagram
   + references.

     Oct 25/97: Htmlise+ add blurb on DNS capable machines
   ______________________________________________________________________

   After finally settling down and properly reading TFM (the Bat Book, to
   be precise) i have solved the Caramilk secret! The steps below have
   been tested with the binary supplied by RedHat. Perhaps i should send
   this tip to the maintainer of the Sendmail FAQ too since there is
   absolutely no mention of UUCP interworking with sendmail there.

What this Document tries to show you

   How to setup a single machine, reffered to as me.com in the example,
   with no direct access to the internet to route mail for you via
   sendmail and UUCP to a 'smarter host' eg your ISP.
   Optionally you can configure this machine to feed other machines i.e
   you are their 'smart' host or gateway.

What this Document does not tell you

   I have been receiving incredible number of questions regarding topics
   which are beyond the focus of this HOWTO. The purpose of this document
   is not to describe them so please try not send me any questions on the
   following:


  a) How to setup UUCP.

   Refer to many fine references on this, including:

     UUCP HOWTO (Vince Skahan, )

     Using and managing UUCP (Ed Ravin et al -- publisher O'reilly) which
   i think is the best authority on UUCP

THE SETUP

   This is for a system, hypothecally named me.com, whose mail is sent
   out only via UUCP. mysmarthost is the ISPs hostname as set up in the
   uucp sys file and me.com is the hostname we use or are known by in the
   MX records on the internet.
   mysmarthost hooks to the internet. We really dont care how it does it,
   we just know it knows how to get us there.
   me.com, whose setup we describe in the example, feeds sites down.com
   and system1.org and their subnodes. me.com connects to down.com via
   TCP/IP and connects to system1.org via raw UUCP using a phone line.
   The setup description is shown below:

 pre-requisites

   1) If you are already running DNS or have a pointer to a DNS server
   (in your /etc/resolv.conf) and are on a live connection to the net
   then skip this part. You are safe. You dont have to do any 'smart'
   thing skip to  2)
   If you are on a machine using uucp for mail then you dont really need
   to compile bind/resolv into sendmail;

  How to survive name canonicalization on a stand-alone machine with no DNS

   PART I
    If you get a pre-compiled sendmail with BIND in it you can still live
   with it (As is the case with Redhat supplied sendmail).

   a) Refer to my solution for this based on the m4 file described (my
   favorite). Try to use this option unless you really insist on b) or c)
   below OR

   b)If you talk to me i could supply you with a non-BIND compiled
   version (8.8.5). Perhaps RedHat should consider supplying two sendmail
   binaries (like slakware) One with BIND and the other with no BIND. OR

   c) The quickest solution to get sendmail with no bind is to edit
   src/conf.h lines below to read as i have shown:

   # ifndef NAMED_BIND conf.h:# define NAMED_BIND 0 /* use Berkeley
   Internet Domain Server */

   PART II:
   Sendmail would however normally insist on doing name look ups to
   resolve the host part using gethostbyaddr() for each email it sends
   (even if you tell it not to canonify names).

   a) use an RFC1597 IP address (10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255,
   172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255, 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255)
   Edit /etc/hosts and add the following as a sample for the host myhost
   10.0.0.1 myhost.me.com myhost or
   b) If you use NIS (and NIS is compiled into sendmail as seems to be
   the case in Redhat. ) make sure the /etc/nsswitch.conf file contains:
   hosts: files dns and in /etc/hosts and add the following as a sample
   for the host myhost [again using RFC1597 IP addressing scheme]
   10.0.0.1 myhost.me.com myhost

   NOTE: ---- In both a) and b) above it is critical that you list the
   long (fully qualified) in the /etc/hosts file used. i.e the line
   should read 10.0.0.1 myhost.me.com myhost and NOT 10.0.0.1 myhost you
   will also need to define the sendmail $w macro to hold myhost.me.com
   add the Following line to your /etc/sendmail.cf after it is generated
   Djmyhost.me.com (or you can use MASQUAREADE_AS(myhost.me.com) in the
   .mc below)

   NOTE!!!!! myhost as a domain name is given as an example; you dont
   have to use it as is. Pick your own hostname if you dont have one
   already.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   2) Ensure that you have makemap and it is capable of supporting hash
   and or the more common dbm format  or even btree format (The Redhat
   version does not support dbm). Makemap is normaly distributed with
   sendmail.


  SETUP (the mc file)

   I) create your .mc file using your favorite editor; i'll call this
   file my.mc

   a) No DNS -- standalone
   ______________________________________________________________________

   include(`../m4/cf.m4')
   VERSIONID(`me.com's setup with uucp created by xxxx --no dns ')
   dnl OSTYPE(linux)
   FEATURE(nodns)dnl
   FEATURE(nocanonify)dnl
   FEATURE(always_add_domain)dnl
   FEATURE(mailertable, hash /etc/mailertable)dnl
   MAILER(local)dnl
   MAILER(smtp)dnl
   MAILER(uucp)
   define(`SMART_HOST', uucp-dom:mysmarthost)
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Let's dissect this:

     include(`../m4/cf.m4') requests for the m4 macro found in
   ../m4/cf.m4 to be include to resolve some things

     VERSIONID(`me.com's setup with uucp created by xxxx')dnl  This is
   used to distinguish the different versions of .cf file you might end
   up creating.

     OSTYPE(linux) This is used to define/redefine linux specific stuff.
   It is safe to have it here.

     FEATURE(nodns)dnl This says we dont have a DNS server (so in effect
   we are using uucp only for mail. Sendmail must be compiled not to use
   bind) This is now obsolete. I will let it stay here just in case you
   use an older version of sendmail.

     FEATURE(nocanonify)dnl This says Don't pass addresses to $[ ... $]
   for canonification. Normally if you have BIND compiled in sendmail
   would try and expand the alias/IP address to a canonical name using
   DNS. You dont wanna do this if all you have are feeds which connect to
   you via UUCP i.e you are a stand alone.

     FEATURE(always_add_domain)dnl This adds the local domain host name
   even on locally delivered mail Not necessary i just like it; This
   might not be a safe feature since spammers, with proper setup
   conditions, can abuse you.
   me.com is not connected to the net via tcp/ip so it is safe

     FEATURE(mailertable, hash /etc/mailertable)dnl the file
   /etc/mailertable is going to be a hash database where we will store
   routing information of certain sites. If you dont have anyone who you
   feed uucp to then you dont need this. More on this later. If you
   wanted to use the dbm format you would have FEATURE(mailertable, dbm
   /etc/mailertable)dnl  If you wanted to use the btree format you would
   have FEATURE(mailertable, btree /etc/mailertable)dnl

     MAILER(local)dnl MAILER(smtp)dnl MAILER(uucp) These are the mailers
   we use.

     define(`SMART_HOST', uucp-dom:mysmarthost) Our smart host is our ISP
   who is defined in the uucp sys file as system mysmarthost. Any
   messages that we cant handle (i.e ones for domains or mailers we dont
   understand) will be passed on to our smarthost/ISP to figure out. note
   we use  uucp-dom as the uucp mailer. This particular mailer uses smtp
   rewriting rules.


   b) DNS on
   ______________________________________________________________________

   include(`../m4/cf.m4')
   VERSIONID(`me.com's setup with uucp created by xxxx --dns enabled')dnl
   OSTYPE(linux)
   FEATURE(always_add_domain)dnl
   FEATURE(mailertable, hash /etc/mailertable)dnl
   MAILER(local)dnl
   MAILER(smtp)dnl
   MAILER(uucp)
   define(`SMART_HOST', uucp-dom:mysmarthost)
   ______________________________________________________________________



  II) create your sendmail.cf file

   a) backup your old /etc/sendmail.cf file
   b) overwrite the sendmail.cf with the new one: m4 my.mc >
   /etc/sendmail.cf
   c) verify that the sendmail.cf file was correctly created based on
   your specifications.
   Some of the gotchas that i came across were: - missing uucp-dom mailer
   This was because i didnt have the smtp mailer entry. Actually, i
   understand it is important to have it defined before the uucp


  III) create your /etc/mailertable

   if you dont have uucp sites feeding off you skip this step

   a) create/edit the file /etc/mailertable

   sample /etc/mailertable
   ______________________________________________________________________

   system1.org uucp-dom:system1
   .system1.org uucp-dom:system1
   down.com uucp-dom:down
   up.down.com  error: Host is unknown at me.com
   .down.com uucp-dom:down
   .me.com error: Host unknown at me.com
   ______________________________________________________________________

   This says anything that is addressed to system1.org or to
   *.system1.org that we receive will be sent using the uucp-dom mailer
   and be delivered to system1 (defined in the the uucp sys file) in
   other words we are doing the mail routing for *.system1.org ; similar
   for down.com and its subnodes except for the additional filtering; we
   bounce back any mail for down's subnode up.down.com using sendmail's
   built-in error mailer with the message "Host is unknown at me.com";
   This is because we have been asked to do this by the admin at
   down.com. To bounce unknown subdomains to us we use the last line in
   the mailertable (which is what all unknown nodes default to).
   b) create the database with makemap

   if you use hash:
   makemap hash /etc/mailertable < /etc/mailertable
   if you use dbm:
   makemap dbm /etc/mailertable </etc/mailertable
   if you use btree:
   makemap btree /etc/mailertable </etc/mailertable

   do this every time you change the file.

  IV) restart sendmail

  V) test sendmail

   i) sendmail -bv user@destination
   ii) using sendmail -bt and enter various addresses using 3,0
   ruleset to see where they end up and the various rulesets and cf walks
   taken.

   You are set!
   ______________________________________________________________________

  TODO

   1) Add info on setting up system down.com (so as to show how to
   take care of those smtp nodes)
   2) Add info on how to setup news to be delivered via UUCP
   (preferably INN). This might require changing the title of the doc.
