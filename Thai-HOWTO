  1.  Introduction

  It's about one year that I didn't update this document. There were a
  lot of movement in Thai computing and using Linux in Thailand. For
  example, Linux boxes are used as server in many schools in Thailand
  <http://www.school.net.th>.

  The purpose of this document is to show how to set your Linux to use
  Thai language. I use Linux RedHat 5.0 as I wrote this document, so
  directories which I mention in this document may be different from
  other distribution.
  First I would like to talk about Thai standard character set. Thai
  standard character set is TIS-620. There are also other Thai standard
  character sets such as ISO-IR-166, CP874, etc. Please see
  http://www.inet.co.th/cyberclub/trin/thairef/
  <http://www.inet.co.th/cyberclub/trin/thairef/> for further
  information about Thai standard character set.  TIS-620 is 8-bit
  character set. It has the same range as ISO-8859-1, so we can use
  apllications that support ISO-8859-1 character set also. Although we
  can use Thai language with apllications that support ISO-8859-1
  character set, but it does not mean those applications support Thai
  language.

  Thai characters are different from English characters.  There is a
  variation of position, normal position, character can be on other
  character, character can be under other character. There is no space
  between words. These are some problems in developing Thai supported
  application.

  You can find the lastest version of Thai-HOWTO document from

  2.  Thai Input and Output

  2.1.  Linux console

  Thai characters do not display properly in Linux console. If you
  mainly use X window, you may pass this section.

  2.1.1.  Thai fonts

  You can obtain Linux Thai console fonts which created by Mr. Phaisarn
  Techajaruwong from ZzzThai ftp site
  <ftp://ftp.fedu.uec.ac.jp/pub/thai/UEC/ZzzThai/Sofware/Linux/fonts/console>

  For example, there is a font name "phaisarn.psf". Put it in
  /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts/ directory. Then, you can load the new font
  from Linux console by command


       %setfont phaisarn.psf



  2.1.2.  Keyboard layout

  You can set keyboard behavior as you like by using loadkeys command.
  Usually, you use loadkeys to load the file located in
  /usr/lib/kbd/keytables. You can create a US/Thai keyboard-map file and
  save it in this directory. Here is a sample.

  Suppose you save this file as thai.map. From Linux console, use
  command loadkeys to load thai.map.


       %loadkeys thai.map



  You can switch to Thai keyboard by pressing the right Alt key. If you
  want to switch the keyboard back, press the right Alt key again.



  2.2.  X Window system

  2.2.1.  Thai fonts

  You can obtain Thai fonts in bdf format or pcf format from internet.
  You can also use scalable fonts such as Type1 or TrueType fonts. But I
  will not describe about these.



  2.2.1.1.  Installing Thai fonts

  You must log in as root. Let's put Thai fonts in
  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/, this is a default font path. Change
  directory to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/ and run command


       %mkfontdir
       %xset fp rehash



  If you put Thai fonts in different directory, you must use xset to add
  the new font path. Please see man-page for further information.  You
  can check the new fonts by running command xlsfonts and see whether
  there are Thai fonts or not. If you can not see any Thai fonts from
  this command, you may need to restart X window.



  2.2.2.  There are two ways to map Thai keyboard on X window, using X
  Keyboard Extension (XKB) and using xmodmap . Please select how you map
  Thai keyboard. I recommend using XKB.  Thai keyboard layout



  2.2.2.1.  XKB and Thai keyboard layout.

  Beginning with XFree86 3.1.2D, you can use the new X11R6.1 XKEYBOARD
  extension to manage the keyboard layout. This is very helpful.

  During X server configuration with xf86config you will be asked about
  XKB, if you want to to set Thai keyboard layout for your system, say
  yes. There are a list of pre-configured keymaps. Choose Standard
  101-key, Thai encoding.

  XF86Setup is the graphical X server configuration utility for XFree86
  X server.  It is easier than traditional xf86config. You can select a
  keyboard layout easily with this tool.

  Ther are many choices of keyboard switch key to select. The default is
  LeftAlt+RightShift switch to Thai and LeftAlt+LeftShift switch to US.
  You can type Thai characters in any applications which support
  ISO-8859-1 character set, but don't forget to use Thai fonts with
  those applications too.

  I found that pre-configured keymaps that came with XFree86-3.2 is not
  correct. You may not be able to type THO THUNG which located at " 5
  key " . To fix this problem, you should add the line


           key <AE05> {        [], [   paragraph,      ocircumflex     ]       };



  in the file /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols/th as the example.


       .................
           key <AE03> {        [], [       minus,      ograve          ]       };
           key <AE04> {        [], [      Agrave,      oacute          ]       };
           key <AE05> {        [], [   paragraph,      ocircumflex     ]       };
           key <AE06> {        [], [    Ooblique,      Ugrave          ]       };
           key <AE07> {        [], [  Odiaeresis,      ssharp          ]       };
       .................



  You can not type SORUSI also. Please change the line from


           key <AC08> {        [], [      Ograve,      eacute          ]       };



  to


           key <AC08> {        [], [      Ograve,      Eacute          ]       };



  Note that eacute is equal to MAITHO and Eacute is equal to SORUSI.

  There are also XKB extension utilities such as setxkbmap, xkbcomp,
  etc. Please see man-page for more information. I recommend to use
  xkbvled. The leds will be on when you are using Thai keyboard so you
  can know your keyboard's status.
  The following is part of XF86Config file about keyboard section. If
  you want to configure the keyboard by hand, change the content of
  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config as an example below. This configuration
  uses the default toggle key.


       Section "Keyboard"
          Protocol        "Standard"
          AutoRepeat      500 5
          LeftAlt         Meta
          RightAlt        Meta
          ScrollLock      Compose
          RightCtl        Control
       #  XkbDisable
          XkbKeycodes     "xfree86"
          XkbTypes        "default"
          XkbCompat       "default"
          XkbSymbols      "us(pc101)"
          XkbGeometry     "pc"
          XkbRules        "xfree86"
          XkbModel        "pc101"
          XkbLayout       "th"
       EndSection



  If you use XKB extension, Thai keyboard mapping with xmodmap may not
  work.  See XF86Config man-page for mor information.


  2.2.2.2.  Thai keyboard layout with xmodmap

  You can use the utility xmodmap to map Thai keyboard.  Normally
  xmodmap is used to load a keyboard configured file.  For most Linux
  distributions, when you start X window with startx, X server will find
  .Xmodmap in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/ first. If .Xmodmap does not
  exist, X server will find .Xmodmap in your home directory. Please see
  the content of /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.

  The following is the sample of .Xmodmap for Thai Kedmanee keyboard
  layout.



  !
  ! Linux/XFree86 Thai Kedmanee layout (based on US keyboard)
  ! Use ScrollLock to switch to Thai keyboard.
  ! This file will work with XFree86 only.

  Just put .Xmodmap in your home directory will be OK. When you start X
  window, X server will load this file.

  You can also load .Xmodmap from command line.


  %xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap



  In above .Xmodmap file, US/Thai switch key is assigned to keycode 0x4E
  (78), Scroll Lock key, with the statement


       ______________________________________________________________________
       keycode 0x4E =  Mode_switch     XF86ModeLock
       ______________________________________________________________________



  XF86ModeLock is the special keysym for XFree86 X server. If you don't
  add this keysym, you have to hold the scroll lock key while you are
  typing Thai characters. Note that if you use commercial X server, some
  keycodes are different. You may have to map keyboard by yourself.  See
  man-pages of X and xev for further information.


  Note: If you are using XFree86 version 3.1.2D or later, you need to
  add the line XkbDisable in keyboard section of XF86Config file. You
  may config the keyboard section like the following sample.


       Section "Keyboard"
          Protocol        "Standard"
          AutoRepeat      500 5
          LeftAlt         Meta
          RightAlt        ModeShift
          ScrollLock      ModeLock
          RightCtl        Compose
          XkbDisable
       EndSection



  3.  Applications with Thai language

  This is the tricky part. Most applications support ISO-8859-1
  character set. For example, emacs can display ISO-8859-1 character. If
  we set emacs to display ISO-8859-1 and use Thai font, you can edit
  Thai document with emacs. But this is not a good policy. You should
  avoid using this trick as possible. What we need is Thai locale or
  Thai supported applications to manage these things.


  To make X window application displays Thai font, you should run the
  application with -fn option. For example,


       %xedit -fn thai8x16



  Note that thai8x16 is just a one of Thai font names. You can see all
  available fonts by command xlfonts.  If you don't want to fill -fn
  option every time you run application. You should set Thai font in
  your ~/.Xdefaults or ~/.Xresources like this


       XTerm*font:     thai8x16



  3.1.  Some X applications and Thai language



  3.1.1.  txterm

  txterm is Thai version of xterm. There are several programs running
  under xterm such as shell, pine, vi, less, etc. We can type Thai
  characters without any problems with txterm. Txterm also provides its
  own Thai input method by pressing " F1 " key. Txterm will use fonts
  thai9x13 as default Thai font. You can change this by add -fn option.

  You can get txterm from Thaigate <http://thaigate.nacsis.ac.jp> or
  ZzzThai
  <ftp://ftp.fedu.uec.ac.jp/pub/thai/UEC/ZzzThai/Software/Linux>.



     bash shell :
        Normally, shell accepts only ASCII character set. To type Thai
        characters in shell command line, you should set environment
        LC_CTYPE to iso_8859_1.

        I don't set LC_CTYPE environment variable to iso_8859_1 because
        this environment variable will effect other applications too.
        With bash shell, you can specify which environment variable to
        be passed to the application. For example, I can make a fake
        Thai X terminal with this syntax.


          LC_CTYPE=iso_8859_1 xterm -fn thai8x16



     This xterm display Thai characters well, but not good for typing
     Thai characters. I strongly recommend you to use txterm.


     ls :
        If you name a filename in Thai. Issue the command as


          ls -N



     You may set alias in ~/.bashrc or ~/.cshrc, so you can type ls
     without option. If you don't use ls with -N option, you may see
     Thai filename as ?????.


  3.1.2.  Emacs, Mule

  Mule stands for " Multilingual Enhancement to GNU Emacs " . It has the
  same functions as emacs and supports many languages. Mule provides its
  own input method, so you don't need any configuration for typing Thai.
  You needs only Thai fonts for mule which you can get from, ZzzThai
  <ftp://ftp.fedu.uec.ac.jp/pub/thai/UEC/ZzzThai/Software/Linux/fonts/>
  or Etl site <ftp://etlport.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/fonts/ETL/>.  These Thai
  fonts are fixed width fonts.

  You need some configuration for mule. Puts the following lines in your
  .emacs.


       ;;
       ;; Thai System, add in .emacs
       ;;
       (set-file-coding-system-for-read '*tis620*)
       (set-default-file-coding-system '*tis620*)
       (set-display-coding-system '*tis620*)
       (set-keyboard-coding-system '*tis620*)
       (setq-deafault quail-current-package (assoc "thai" quail-package-alist))



  Add the following lines in .Xdefaults.


       !
       ! Emacs, Mule - Font menu
       !
       Emacs*FontSetList: thai14, thai16, thai24
       Emacs*FontSet-thai14:\
               -etl-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-140-72-72-m-70-tis620.2529-1
       Emacs*FontSet-thai16:\
               -etl-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-m-80-tis620.2529-1
       Emacs*FontSet-thai24:\
               -etl-fixed-medium-r-normal--24-500-72-72-m-120-tis620.2529-1



  When you hold shift key and press left mouse's button, you can select
  Thai fonts to display in mule window.  To type Thai characters, press
  " Ctrl + ] " . To type English, press " Ctrl + ] " again.

  You can get mule from ElectroTechnical Laboratory(ETL)

  3.1.3.  vi

  Vi should be run on txterm.


  3.1.4.  pine

  In the past, we could not send 8-bit characters through E-mail. Now,
  although mail transfer agent can handle 8-bit characters but some old
  mail transfer agent can not.  We can send Thai e-mail by using e-mail
  application that supports MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
  E-mail applications that support MIME are pine, elm, Netscape mail,
  etc.


  Put the following definition in your ~/.pinerc file:


       character-set=ISO-8859-1



  This can also be set via the Setup option in pine window. You can find
  it under Config. You can read Thai news from pine, too.

  Pine should be run in txterm.


  3.1.5.  Netscape

  If you have Thai fonts in your system. Just set Thai font from
  preference. Thai fonts will appear in User defined area. See
  http://www.fedu.uec.ac.jp/ZzzThai/unix
  <http://www.fedu.uec.ac.jp/ZzzThai/unix> for setting Thai language on
  Netscape.

  3.1.6.  Ss, Simple thai word Separator

  ss is a dictionary based Thai word separation program similar to
  cttex. It can be used to insert a configurable string between Thai
  words. It can also show words that cannot be found in the dictionary.
  More words can be added to the dictionary. Developed by Mr.Teera
  Kittichareonpot.

  We can use this program to insert < WBR > tag between Thai words in
  html file. Browser will display Thai homepage better than normal html
  document.


  3.1.7.  Xzthai, X keyboard configurator + simple editor

  Xzthai, this is the Tcl/Tk application for mapping Thai keyboard on
  any keyboard with graphical user interface. Also provides simple
  editor and keyboard layout figure. It actually uses xmodmap program in
  background to map Thai keyboard. This may be useful for commercial X
  server and X server on UNIX.


  3.2.  Printing Thai document

  Thai2ps is used to convert plain text file to postscript file.You can
  use ghostscript(gs) to print your Thai document. For better quality
  document, you have to use (La)TeX.


  3.2.1.  Latex and Thai language

  Dr. Manop Wongsaisuwan first tried to use Thai language with latex. He
  wrote some perl script as filter for latex source code that contains
  Thai language. Then pass the result to latex. Mr. Vuthichai
  Ampornaramvech used this concept and wrote a program in C language,
  cttex, to handle this. It runs faster and makes Thai word segmentation
  based on dictionary. Cttex also fixes the position of Thai characters
  in word, so SARA and WANNAYUK will be placed in the beautiful
  position.
  You can find Thai latex filter from
  http://thaigate.nacsis.ac.jp/files/ttex.html
  <http://thaigate.nacsis.ac.jp/files/ttex.html>.


  3.2.2.  Latex's configuration for Thai language

  You must have latex installed in your computer.  First, download Thai
  postscript (Type1) fonts, tfm fonts and Thai style file. These fonts
  are needed by Latex. This is the list of files you should download.


       tfm fonts:
           dbtt.tfm    dbttb.tfm   dbttbi.tfm  dbtti.tfm
       postscript fonts:
           dbtt.pfa    dbttb.pfa   dbttbi.pfa  dbtti.pfa
       style files:
           thai.sty sakka.sty
       Thai Latex filter:
           cttex
       Sample Latex file:
           ttex.ttex test.ttex



  There is latex's directory at /usr/lib/texmf/texmf/ (RedHat 5.0). I
  will call /usr/lib/texmf/texmf/ as " $texroot " . We will concentrate
  at $texroot/texmf/ directory.  In $texroot/texmf/ directory, there are
  many files about tex's configuration. You have to edit files in dvips,
  fonts, tex subdirectories.

  Add the following lines to $texroot/texmf/dvips/misc/psfonts.map


       dbtt  DBThaiText <dbtt.pfa
       dbttb DBThaiTextBold <dbttb.pfa
       dbttbi DBThaiTextBoldItalic <dbttbi.pfa
       dbtti DBThaiTextItalic <dbtti.pfa



  Make a new directories and copy files to the appropriate directories.


       %mkdir /usr/lib/texmf/texmf/fonts/tfm/public/thai
       %mkdir /usr/lib/texmf/texmf/fonts/type1/public/thai
       %mkdir /usr/lib/texmf/texmf/tex/generic/thai
       %cp *.tfm /usr/lib/texmf/texmf/fonts/tfm/public/thai
       %cp *.pfa /usr/lib/texmf/texmf/fonts/type1/public/thai
       %cp *.sty /usr/lib/texmf/texmf/tex/generic/thai



  Run texhash or MakeTeXls-R(in some system) to update Tex database.


       %/usr/bin/texhash
       texhash: updating /usr/lib/texmf/texmf/ls-R ...
       texhash: Done.

  3.2.3.  Use Thai LaTeX  filter

  We can use cttex as filter like this,


       %cttex < ttex.ttex > ttex.tex
       C-TTeX $Revivsion: 1.15 $
       Usage : cttex [cutcode] < infile > outfile
       Usage : cutcode=0 forces operation in HTML mode.
       Build-in dictionary size: 9945 words
        343
       Done
       %latex ttex.tex
       ...
       %xdvi ttex.dvi



  You can convert dvi file to postscript file by,


       %dvips -o ttex.ps ttex.dvi



  Finally, you can print ttex.ps by using gs or lpr. You must configure
  printer before printing. See man-pages of printcap, gs, lpr for more
  information.


  3.2.4.  Editing LaTex  source file

  For new latex user, lyx is helpful. But I recommend to use mule to
  edit Thai latex source file because mule supports Thai language and it
  is a powerful editor. You may take a look a Thai Latex tutorial
  <http://www.fedu.uec.ac.jp/ZzzThai/Linux/ttex>.



  3.3.  X Application Resources

  Because Xt based applications allow user to configure the applications
  by resources. We can make the menu or label to be Thai language.

  For example, if you want xman to display Thai labels. You may add
  these lines in your .Xdefaults


       ......
       !!  Xman section
       Xman*Font:                          thai8x16
       Xman*helpButton.Label:
       Xman*quitButton.Label:
       Xman*manpageButton.Label:
       ......



  You can use the same idea to set window manager to be more Thai
  environment too.



  3.4.  Thai Extension for Linux (TE)

  Thai Extension for Linux is a installation package comes with
  applicaions and Thai fonts. You don't have to configure Linux system
  and applications by yourself.  Let TE do configuration task for you.
  After installation, you can use Thai language suddenly. Get TE from
  ftp://fedu.uec.ac.jp/pub/thai/UEC/ZzzThai/Software/Linux/
  <ftp://fedu.uec.ac.jp/pub/thai/UEC/ZzzThai/Software/Linux/>
