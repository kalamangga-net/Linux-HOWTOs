  1.  Introduction

  This document gives you an overview of the Apache world, including
  Apache Software Foundation projects such as the Apache web server and
  commercial and open source third party software.  Apache is the most
  popular server on the Internet <http://www.netcraft.com/survey/>. New
  Apache users, especially those coming from a Windows background, are
  often unaware of the possibilities of Apache, its useful addons and,
  more in general, how everything works together. This document aims to
  show a general picture of such possibilities with a brief description
  of each one and pointers for further information.  The information has
  been gathered from many sources, including projects' web pages,
  conference talks, mailing lists, Apache websites and my own hands-on
  experience. Full credit is given to these authors. Without them and
  their work, this document would not have been possible or necessary.

  1.1.  Apache Software Foundation

  The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache
  community of open-source software projects. The Apache projects are
  characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process,
  an open and pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high
  quality software that leads the way in its field. We consider
  ourselves not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather
  a community of developers and users.

  The ASF is home to many successful Open Source projects, such as the
  Tomcat Servlet/JSP engine and the ANT build tool.

  You can learn more about the foundation here
  <http://www.apache.org/foundation/>.


  1.2.  Structure of this document

  The first part of this document deals with the Apache Web Server and
  related modules. It covers the history, architecture and capabilities
  of the server and describes ways in which you can extend and customize
  it.

  The second part of this document covers projects of the Apache
  Software Foundation, such as those form the Jakarta and Java XML
  communities. Rather than organizing the projects around a certain
  programming language or technology, they are organized based on
  functionality provided.


  2.  Apache

  Apache is the leading internet web server, with over 60% market share,
  according to the Netcraft survey <http://www.netcraft.com/survey>.
  Several key factors have contributed to Apache's success:

    The Apache license <http://www.apache.org/LICENSE.txt>. It is an
     open source, BSD-like license that allows for both commercial and
     non-commercial uses of Apache.

    Talented community of developers
     <http://www.apache.org/foundation/members.html> with a variety of
     backgrounds and an open development process based on technical
     merits.

    Modular architecture. Apache users can easily add functionality or
     tailor Apache to their specific enviroment.

    Portable: Apache runs on nearly all flavors of Unix (and Linux),
     Windows, BeOs, mainframes...

    Robustness and security.

     Many commercial vendors have adopted Apache-based solutions for
     their products, including Oracle <http://www.oracle.com>, Red Hat
     <http://www.redhat.com> and IBM <http://www.ibm.com>.  In addition,
     Covalent <http://www.covalent.net> provides add-on modules and 24x7
     support for Apache.

  The following websites use Apache or derivatives. Chances are that if
  Apache is good enough for them, it is also good enough for you :)

  >From the Apache website <http://httpd.apache.org>:

  The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
  open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX
  and Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure,
  efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync
  with the current HTTP standards.

  Apache started its life as modifications to the NCSA Web server, one
  of the first HTTP servers. You can learn more about Apache's history
  here <http://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html>:

  The Apache project has grown beyond building just a web server into
  developing other critical server side technologies. The Apache
  Software Foundation, described in a later section, serves as an
  umbrella for these projects.


  2.1.  Architecture

  There are two main versions of Apache, the 1.3 series and the 2.0
  series. Although both versions are considered production quality, they
  differ in architecture and capabilities.


  2.1.1.  2.1.1 Apache 1.3

  Apache 1.3 has been ported to a great variety of Unix platforms and is
  the most widely deployed Web server on the Internet.


  2.1.1.1.  Process-based Web server

  Apache 1.3 on Unix is a process-based Web server. The Apache program
  forks several children at startup. Forking means that a parent process
  makes identical copies of itself, called children. Each one of the
  children can serve a request independent of the others. This approach
  has the advantage of improved stability: If one of the children
  misbehaves (runs out of control or has memory leaks) it can be
  terminated without affecting the others.  The stability comes with a
  performance penalty. In most Unix operating systems, creating
  processes and context switching (assigning processor time to each
  process) are expensive operations. Since processes are isolated from
  each other, they cannot easily share code and data, consuming system
  resources.


  2.1.1.2.  Windows support

  Apache 1.3 is the first version of Apache to support Windows, although
  the port is not considered to be as stable as its Unix counterparts.
  This is due to the fact that the server had been designed with Unix in
  mind and the Windows port was a later addition that did not integrate
  very well.


  2.1.1.3.  Modular

  Apache 1.3 has a modular architecture. You can enable or disable
  modules to add and remove Web server functionality. You can customize
  Apache to improve performance and security. In addition to modules
  bundled with the server, there is a great number of third party
  modules, providing extended functionality.


  2.1.2.  2.1.2 Apache 2.0

  Apache 2.0 is the latest and greatest version of the Apache server.
  The architecture contains significant improvements over the 1.3
  series. The following are some of them.



  2.1.2.1.  Multi Processing Modules

  Apache 2.0 abstracts the request processing architecture in special
  server modules, called Multi Processing modules (MPMs). This means
  that Apache can be configured to be a pure process-based server, a
  purely threaded server or a mixture of those models. Threads are
  contained inside processes and run simultaneously. Unlike processes,
  threads can share data and code. Threads are thus more "lighweight"
  than processes, and in most cases threaded servers scale better than
  process based servers. The disadvantage is that the server is less
  reliable, since if a thread misbehaves it can corrupt data or code
  belonging to other threads.


  2.1.2.2.  Protocol Modules

  The protocol handling has been encapsulated in its own layer in Apache
  2.0. That means it is possible to write modules to serve protocols
  other than HTTP, such as POP3 for mail or FTP for file transfer. These
  protocol modules can take advantage of a solid server framework and
  module functionality, such as authentication and dynamic content
  generation. This means that, for example, you can authenticate your
  POP3 users against the same user database Apache uses for web requests
  and that FTP content can be generated dynamically using PHP, CGI or
  any other technologies explained later in this document.


  2.1.2.3.  Module and filter architecture.

  Apache 2.0 maintains the 1.3 modular architecture and adds an
  additional extension mechanism: filters. Filters allow modules to
  modify the content generated by other modules. They can encrypt, scan
  for viruses or compress not only static files but dynamically
  generated content.


  2.1.2.4.  Compatibility issues

  Unfortunately, though the module API is similar between versions, they
  are not identical and Apache 1.3 modules need to be ported to the new
  architecture. Most mainstream modules such as PHP and mod_perl already
  have Apache 2.0 versions and others, such as mod_dav and mod_ssl, are
  now part of the server distribution. Running modules on a threaded
  architecture requires specific changes to modules. Modules distributed
  with Apache have undergone those changes and are considered `thread-
  safe', but third-party modules or libraries may not. If you need one
  of those, you will be limited to running Apache as a pure process-
  based server.


  2.1.2.5.  Portable

  Apache runs equally well now on Windows and Unix platforms thanks to
  the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. It abstracts the
  differences among operating systems, such as file or network access
  APIs. Porting Apache to a new platform is often as simple as porting
  the Apache Portable Runtime.  This abstraction layer also provides for
  platform-specific tuning and optimization.



  2.2.  Security

  Apache provides several security-related modules for securing and
  restricting access to the server.


  2.2.1.  Authentication

  Authentication modules allow you to determine the identity of a
  client, usually by verifying an username and password against a
  backend database.  Apache includes modules to authenticate against
  plain text and database files.  Additional authentication modules
  exist that connect Apache to existing security frameworks or
  databases, including: NT Domain controller, Oracle, mySQL, PostgresSQL
  and so on.

  The LDAP modules are specially interesting, as they allow integration
  with company and enterprise wide existing directory services.  You can
  find these modules at .  An Apache 2.0 LDAP module can be found at the
  Apache website
  <http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_auth_ldap.html>.



  2.2.2.  Access Control

  Apache provides the mod_access module that can restrict access to
  resources based on parameters of the client request, such as the
  presence of a specific header or the IP address or hostname of the
  client. Third party modules allow you to restrict access to clients
  that misbehave, as explained in later sections on performance and
  bandwidth control.


  2.2.3.  SSL/TLS

  The Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security protocols allow data
  between the Web server and client to be encrypted. In Apache 1.3, the
  protocols are implemented by mod_ssl, which is distributed separately
  from the mod_ssl website <http://www.modssl.org> and requires applying
  patches to the server. This was necessary because of export
  regulations on encryption. Most of those restrictions have since then
  being lifted and starting with Apache 2.0, mod_ssl is now included as
  a base module with Apache.

  2.3.  Proxy

  A proxy is a program that performs requests on behalf of another.
  There are different kind of Web proxies. A traditional HTTP proxy,
  also called a forward proxy, accepts requests from clients (usually
  Web browsers), contacts the remote server, and returns the responses.

  A reverse proxy is a Web server that is placed in front of other
  servers, providing a unified front end and offloading certain tasks,
  such as SSL processing, from the backend Web servers.

  Apache supports both types of proxy, caching of proxied content and
  differente proxy backends such as FTP.


  2.4.  Performance and scalability

  Raw performance is only one of the factors to consider in a web server
  (flexibility and stability come usually first).

  Having said that, there are solutions to improve performance on heavy
  loaded webservers serving static content. If you are in the hosting
  business Apache also provides ways in which you can measure and
  control bandwidth usage.  Throttling in this context usually means
  slowing down the delivery of content based on the file requested, a
  specific client IP address and so on. This is done to prevent abuse.

    mod_mmap: Included in current Apache 1.3 releases, it maps to
     memory a statically configured list of files that are frequently
     requested but infrequently changed. This functionality is included
     in mod_file_cache in Apache 2.

    Mod_bandwidth <http://www.cohprog.com/mod_bandwidth.html>: This
     Apache 1.3 module enables the setting of server-wide or per
     connection bandwidth limits, based on the specific directory, size
     of files and remote IP/domain.

    Bandwidth share module
     <http://www.topology.org/src/bwshare/README.html>: provides
     bandwidth throttling and balancing by client IP address. It
     supports Apache 1.3 and earlier versions of Apache 2.

    Mod_throttle
     <http://www.snert.com/Software/Throttle/index.shtml>:Throttle
     bandwidth per virtual host or user. For Apache 1.3

  2.4.1.  Load Balancing

  Using the Apache reverse proxy and mod_rewrite you can have an Apache
  process distributing requests among a variety of backend web servers.
  You can find more information at

  Additionally, mod_backhand is an Apache 1.3 module that allows
  seamless redirection of HTTP requests from one web server to another.
  This redirection can be used to target machines with under-utilized
  resources, thus providing fine-grained, per-request load balancing of
  web requests. You can find more information at .


  2.4.2.  Compression

  Apache 2.0 includes mod_deflate, a filtering module that compresses
  content before delivering it to clients. This saves bandwidth but can
  have a performance impact. The mod_gzip module
  <http://www.remotecommunications.com/apache/mod_gzip/> provides this
  functionality for Apache 1.3
  2.5.  CGI scripts

  CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface. CGI programs are external
  programs that are called when a user requests a certain page. The CGI
  program receives information from the web server (form variable
  values, type of browser, IP address of the client and so on) and uses
  that information to output a web page to the client.

  Apache has support for CGIs and there is a third-party Apache 1.3
  module that provides support for the FastCGI protocol. It avoids the
  performance penalties associated with starting and stopping a CGI
  program with every request. You can find it at


  2.6.  Development Platform Integration

  Web applications are written in high-level languages such as Java,
  Perl, C# and so on and Apache has several modules that integrate them
  with the server. In many cases the modules expose the Apache API so
  entire Apache modules can be written in those languages.

  2.6.1.  Perl

  mod_perl <http://perl.apache.org/> is one of the most veteran and
  successful Apache projects. It embeds a Perl interpreter in Apache and
  allows access to the web server internals from Perl. This allows for
  entire modules to be written in Perl or a mixture of Perl and C code.
  In the 1.3 Apache versions, one interpreter has to be embedded in each
  child, since the server is multiprocess based.  In heavy traffic
  dynamic sites, the increased size could make a difference.  In
  threaded versions of Apache 2.0 mod_perl allows for sharing of code,
  data and session state among interpreters. This results in a faster,
  leaner solution.

  mod_perl is in itself another platform, with a great variety of
  modules available such as Mason <www.masonhq.com> and Embperl
  <http://perl.apache.org/embperl/> for embedding Perl in HTML pages and
  AxKit <axkit.org> for XML-driven templates.


  2.6.2.  PHP

  From the PHP <http://www.php.net> website: PHP is a server-side,
  cross-platform, HTML embedded scripting language. It is the most
  popular module for Apache
  <http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.200209/apachemods.html>
  and this is due to a variety of reasons:

    Learning curve is quite low

    Great documentation

    Extensive database support

    Modularity

     PHP has a modular design. Among many others, there are modules that
     provide support for:

    Database connetivity for popular databases such as Oracle, MS-SQL
     server, ODBC interface, MySQL, mSQL, PostgreSQL and so on.

    XML support

    File transfer: FTP

    HTTP

    Directory support: LDAP

    Mail support: IMAP, POP3, NNTP

    PDF document generation

    CORBA

    SNMP

     You only need to compile/use the modules you need. PHP can be used
     with Apache, as an external CGI or with other webservers.  It is
     crossplatform and it runs on most flavors of Unix and Windows. If
     you come from a Windows background, you probably have used Internet
     Information Server with Active Server Pages and MS-SQL Server. A
     common replacement in the Unix world for this trio is Apache with
     PHP and MySQL.  Since PHP works:

    with Apache and with Microsoft IIS

    with MySQL and with MS-SQL server

    on Unix and on Windows

     you have a nice, gradual migration path from a Microsoft-centric
     solution to Unix based solutions.


  2.6.3.  Python

  Python is a popular object oriented scripting language.  Mod_Python
  <http://www.modpython.org>, which is now an official Apache project,
  allows you to integrate Python with the Apache web server. You can
  develop complex web applications or accelerate existing Python CGI
  scripts. Recent versions run on Apache 2.0.


  2.6.4.  Tcl

  The Tcl Apache project <http://tcl.apache.org> integrates Tcl with the
  Apache webserver. Tcl is a lightweight, extensible scripting language.
  You can learn more about Tcl here <http://tcl.activestate.com/>.
  There are several modules currently under the Apache Tcl umbrella:

    Both Mod_dtcl <http://tcl.apache.org/mod_dtcl/> and Neowebscript
     <http://tcl.apache.org/neowebscript/> allow embedding Tcl on HTML
     pages. Rivet <http://tcl.apache.org/rivet/> combines the best of
     both modules.

    Mod_tcl <http://tcl.apache.org/mod_tcl/mod_tcl.html> takes an
     approach similar to mod_perl, exposing the Apache API.

    WebSH <http://tcl.apache.org/websh/> provides a Tcl Web application
     environment


  2.6.5.  Microsoft technologies

  Several modules allow integration with Microsoft languages and
  technologies such as the .Net framework or Active Server Pages.



  2.6.5.1.  .Net

  mod_haydn <http://haydn.sourceforge.net/> integrates Mono
  <http://www.go-mono.com> with Apache and exposes the Apache API to the
  .Net framework, allowing you to write modules in C#, for example.
  Covalent <http://www.covalent.net> provides mod_asp.net, an commercial
  Windows module that allows Apache to run ASP.Net applications,
  allowing you to replace Microsoft IIS.

  2.6.5.2.  ASP

  ASP stands for Active Server Pages and is a Microsoft technology that
  allows you to embed code, usually Visual Basic, in HTML pages. Several
  companies such as ChilliSoft <http://www.chilisoft.com/> and Stryon
  <http://www.stryon.com/> provide products that can run ASP
  applications on Unix environments.

  2.6.5.3.  ISAPI

  ISAPI is an API that you can use to extend Microsoft IIS, similarly to
  how you would use the Apache API. Apache includes a module mod_isapi
  that mirrors this functionality and allows you to run ISAPI modules.


  2.6.6.  Java

  Most applications servers, such as those from Oracle, IBM and BEA
  provide modules to integrate with the Apache web server. Additionally,
  several modules such as mod_jk and mod_webapp allow you to connect to
  Tomcat, a Servlet and JavaServer Pages container that is also part of
  the Apache Software Foundation.


  2.6.7.  Modules for other languages

  This document has described modules for popular server side languages
  such as Perl, Python and PHP. You can find additional language modules
  (JavaScript, Haskell, Ruby and others) at the Apache modules directory
  <http://modules.apache.org>.


  2.7.  Management

  An important part of Web server administration includes building,
  configuring and monitoring different servers.


  2.7.1.  Build tools

  Apache can be extended and customized in many different ways.
  Integration of different modules with the server can sometimes be a
  difficult task.  Tools such as the Apache Toolbox
  <http://www.apachetoolbox.com> can make this task easier, by providing
  a menu driven build framework.


  2.7.2.  User Interfaces for Apache

  Apache is configured thru text configuration files, and that sometimes
  can be hard, specially for people coming from a Windows background.
  There are open source graphical tools that make this task easier:

    Comanche <http://www.comanche.org>, by yours truly, is
     crossplatform and runs on Unix/Linux, Windows and Mac.


    Webmin <http://www.webmin.com/webmin/>: A nice web based interface.

    gui.apache.org <http://gui.apache.org>: GUI interfaces for Apache
     project. Programs are in various degrees of development.


  2.7.3.  SNMP

  SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol. It allows
  monitoring and management of network servers, equipment and so on.
  SNMP modules for Apache help manage large deployments of web servers,
  measure the quality of service offered and integration of Apache with
  existing management frameworks.

    Open source Mod SNMP
     <http://www.simpleweb.org/software/packages/mod-snmp/> for Apache
     1.3.

    Covalent SNMP <http://www.covalent.net> provides a commercial SNMP
     module, support for the latest SNMPv3 standard, integration with
     HP-Openview, Tivoli and so on.


  2.8.  Publishing

  Authors of Web content require a means of managing that content and
  uploading it to the server. One of the protocols used for this purpose
  is DAV (Distributed Authoring and Versioning). DAV is an extension to
  the HTTP protocol that enables users and applications to publish and
  modify Web content. DAV technology is widely implemented, Microsoft
  supports it at the operating system level (WebFolders) and in its
  Office suite. Same goes for Apple OS-X and a variety of third party
  products from Adobe, Oracle and so on. You can get the mod_dav module
  for Apache 1.3 at . In Apache 2.0, mod_dav is included with the base
  distribution.

  Previous to DAV, Microsoft had its own publishing protocol, integrated
  with the Microsoft FrontPage tool. You can add server-side support for
  Frontpage using the modules at , though due to the way they integrate
  with Apache they are not considered secure.


  2.9.  Protocol modules

  Apache 2.0 introduced the concept of protocol modules. That means that
  developers can reuse the Apache server framework to implement new
  protocols such as those dealing with mail and file transfer. mod_ftp
  is a commercial Apache-based FTP module from Covalent
  <http://www.covalent.net>. mod_pop3
  <http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-pop3/> is an open source
  module that implements the POP3 protocol, commonly used by mail
  readers to retrieve messages from mail servers.


  2.10.  Virtual Hosting

  Apache provides extensive virtual hosting support which means that you
  can serve multiple websites from a single server. In Apache 2.0, with
  the per-child MPM you can have multiple children, each one serving a
  different domain under different Unix user ids. This is very important
  for security in shared hosting scenarios, as it allows you to isolate
  customers from each other. The following are additional, alternative,
  virtual hosting modules.

    mod_dynvhost <http://funkcity.com/0101/>

    mod_pweb <http://www.joytec.de/mod_pweb.html>

    mod_v2h <http://www.fractal.net/mod_v2h.tm>



  2.11.  Commercial support

  Apache is the web server of choice for many commercial entities,
  including big enterprises. These companies have certain requirements
  when adopting a technology, specially one that is at the core of their
  Internet strategy, such as Web servers. Those requirements include
  performance, stability, management capabilities, support, professional
  services and integration with legacy systems. A number of commercial
  companies, such as IBM <http://www.ibm.com>, Red Hat
  <http://www.redhat.com> and Covalent <http://www.covalent.net>,
  provide the products and services necessary to make Apache meet the
  needs of Enterprise customers.

  In addition, many other companies and OEMs ship Apache as a bundled
  web server with their products.



  3.  ASF Projects

  Although Apache is probably the most popular, the Apache Software
  Foundation is home to many other projects. This section provides an
  overview of the most relevant ones, organized logically. Most of them
  belong either to the Jakarta project and the XML project. The Jakarta
  project hosts Java-based projects and the XML project hosts, surprise,
  XML-related projects.


  3.1.  Applications and Frameworks

  The following are application and development frameworks that are part
  of the ASF.


  3.1.1.  3.1.1 Servers

  The following are some ASF server projects.

  3.1.1.1.  Tomcat

  written in Java. It has a modular API that allows aggregation of
  different data sources (XML, SMTP, iCalendar)



  3.1.2.  3.1.2 Content management

  The following are projects related to content management


  3.1.2.1.  Slide

  Slide is a high-level content management framework.  Conceptually, it
  provides a hierarchical organization of binary content which can be
  stored into arbitrary, heterogenous, distributed data stores. In
  addition, Slide integrates security, locking and versioning services.
  It also provides a WebDAV <http://www.webdav.org> server and client
  implementation.  You can learn more at the Slide home page
  <http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/index.html>.


  3.1.2.2.  Alexandria

  Alexandria is an integrated documentation management system. It brings
  together technologies common to many open source projects like CVS and
  JavaDoc.  The goal is to integrate source code and documentation to
  encourage code documentation and sharing. More information at


  3.1.3.  3.1.3 Frameworks

  The following are application development frameworks.


  3.1.3.1.  Turbine

  Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java
  developers to quickly build secure web applications. Turbine brings
  together a platform for running Java code and reusable components.
  Some of its features include: Integration with template systems, MVC
  style development, Access Control Lists, localization support and so
  on. You can find more information at the Turbine web site
  <http://java.apache.org/turbine>.


  3.1.3.2.  Avalon

  If you are familiar with Perl or BSD systems, Avalon is roughly the
  equivalent of CPAN <http://www.cpan.org> or the Ports collection for
  Java Apache technologies. It does not only provide guidelines for a
  common repository of code, it goes one step further: is an effort to
  create, design, develop and maintain a common framework for server
  applications written using the Java language. It provides the means so
  server side Java projects can be easily integrated and build on each
  other.  You can find more information at the Avalon web site
  <http://java.apache.org/avalon/>.
  3.2.  Presentation

  The following template systems, transformation engines and other
  presentation related projects.


  3.2.1.  Cocoon

  Cocoon leverages other Apache XML technologies like Xerces, Xalan and
  FOP to provide a comprehensive XML publishing framework. The framework
  can talk to many different data sources and can transform the content
  into several different delivery formats such as PDF, HTML, XML and
  RTF. It can run as a servlet or as a command line program. You can
  learn more about Cocoon at the project homepage
  <http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/>


  3.2.2.  Velocity

  Velocity is a Java based template engine. It can be used as a stand-
  alone utility for generating source code, HTML, reports, or it can be
  combined with other systems to provide template services.  Velocity
  has a Model View Controller paradigm that enforces separation of Java
  code and the HTML template. You can learn more about Velocity here
  <http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/index.html>.


  3.2.3.  AxKit

  AxKit <http://axkit.org>  is a popular XML-based Application Server
  for mod_perl and Apache. It allows separation of content and
  presentation and provides on-the-fly conversion from XML to any
  format.


  3.2.4.  Xalan

  Xalan is an XSLT processor available for Java and C++.  XSL is a style
  sheet language for XML. The T is for Transformation. XML is good at
  storing structured data (information). You sometimes need to display
  this data to the user or apply some other transformation.  Xalan takes
  the original XML document, reads transformation configuration
  (stylesheet) and outputs HTML, plain text or another XML document.
  You can learn more about Xalan at the Xalan Java
  <http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/index.html> and Xalan C++
  <http://xml.apache.org/xalan-c/index.html> project homepages.


  3.2.5.  FOP

  From the website: FOP is a Java application that reads a formatting
  object tree and then turns it into a PDF document. So FOP takes an XML
  document and outputs PDF, in a similar way that Xalan does with HTML
  or text. You can learn more about FOP here
  <http://xml.apache.org/fop>.



  3.3.  Parsers and Document Access libraries

  The following are different libraries that can be used to parse and
  manipulate a variety of document formats.



  3.3.1.  Xerces

  The Xerces project provides XML parsers for a variety of languages,
  including Java, C++ and Perl. The Perl bindings are based on the C++
  sources.  An XML parser is a tool used for programatic access to XML
  documents.  This is a description of the standards supported by
  Xerces:

    DOM <http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/level-one-
     core.html>: DOM stands for Document Object Model. XML documents are
     hierarchical by nature (nested tags). XML documents can be accessed
     thru a tree like interface. The process is as follows:

    Parse document

    Build tree

    add/delete/modify nodes

    Serialize tree

    SAX <http://www.saxproject.org>:Simple API for XML. This is a
     stream based API. This means that we will receive callbacks as
     elements are encountered. These callbacks can be used to construct
     a DOM tree for example.

    XML Namespaces <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/>

    XML Schema: The XML standard provides the syntax for writing
     documents. XML Schema provides the tools for defining the contents
     of the XML document (semantics). It allows to define that a certain
     element in the document must be an integer between 10 and 20 or
     contain an IP address.

     The Xerces XML project initial code base was donated by IBM. You
     can find more information in the Xerces Java
     <http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/index.html>, Xerces C++
     <http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html> and Xerces Perl
     <http://xml.apache.org/xerces-p/index.html> homepages.


  3.3.2.  Batik

  Batik is a Java based toolkit for applications that want to use images
  in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) <http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/>
  format for various purposes, such as viewing, generation or
  manipulation.

  It is XML centric and compliant with the W3C specification. It is a
  bit atypical from other Apache projects, in that it provides a
  graphical component. Batik provides hooks to extend the framework thru
  custom tags and it allows conversion from SVG to other formats like
  JPEG or PNG.  You can learn more at the Batik homepage
  <http://xml.apache.org/batik/>


  3.3.3.  POI

  The POI project consists of APIs for manipulating various file formats
  based upon Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document format using pure Java.
  This includes Word and Excel documents. You can find more information
  at



  3.4.  Interoperability

  The following are libraries for remote communication and
  interoperability between servers.


  3.4.1.  SOAP

  Apache SOAP ("Simple Object Access Protocol") and Axis are
  implementations of the SOAP protocol <http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP>

  SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a
  decentralized, distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol
  that consists of three parts:

    An envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a
     message and how to process it,

    a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-
     defined datatypes, and

    a convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses.

     Basically you can think of SOAP as an remote procedure call system,
     based on HTTP and XML. On the one hand this means it is verbose and
     slow compared to other systems. On the other hand it eases
     interoperatibility, debugging and development of clients and
     servers for a variety of languages since most modern languages have
     HTTP and XML modules. You can learn more at the Apache SOAP
     homepage <http://xml.apache.org/soap/>


  3.4.2.  XML-RPC

  The XML-RPC project <http://xml.apache.org/xmlrpc/> is a Java
  implementation of the XML-RPC protocol, a light-weight protocol
  similar and predecessor to SOAP.


  3.4.3.  XML security

  The XML security project <http://xml.apache.org/security/> provides
  XML document signature verification for secure exchange of documents.


  3.5.  Development

  3.5.1.  Apache Portable Runtime

  The APR <http://apr.apache.org> project provides a portability layer
  that abstracts a number of APIs for file manipulation, network access
  and so on. It is written in C and works on most Unix flavors, Windows
  and a variety of other systems. It is the basis for Apache 2.0


  3.5.2.  Ant

  Ant <http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/> is a Java based build tool. It
  has a modular API and can be extended by creating new tasks. It is
  driven by XML configuration files.


  3.5.3.  Byte Code Library

  The Byte Code Engineering Library <http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/>
  (BCEL) is a library to analyze, create, and manipulate binary Java
  class files.


  3.5.4.  Log4j

  This package provides a logging framework that Java applications can
  use.  It can be enabled at runtime without modifying the binary and
  has been designed with performance in mind. It can be found at


  3.5.5.  ORO and Regexp

  ORO is a complete package that provides regular expression support for
  Java. It includes Perl5 regular expression support, glob expressions
  and so on.  All under the Apache license.  You can learn more about
  ORO at . There is another ASF lightweight regular expression package,
  Regexp <http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/>.


  3.5.6.  Struts

  Struts is an Apache project that tries to bring the Model-View-
  Controller (MVC) design paradigm to web development. It builds on
  Servlet <http://java.sun.com/products/servlet> and JavaServer Pages
  <http://java.sun.com/products/jsp> technologies. The model part is
  made up of Java server objects, which represent the internal state of
  the application. The view part is constructed via JavaServer Pages
  (JSP), which is a combination of static HTML/XML and Java. JSPs also
  allow the developer to define new tags.  The controller part consists
  of servlets, which take requests (GET/POST) from the client, perform
  actions on the model and update the view by providing the appropriate
  JSP.  You can learn more at the Struts project pages
  <http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/index.html>.


  3.5.7.  Taglibs

  The JavaServer pages technology allows developers to provide
  functionality by adding custom tags. The Taglibs project intends to be
  a common repository for these extensions. It includes tags for common
  utilities (i.e. date), SQL database access and so on.

  You can learn about TagLibs at .  More documentation is included in
  the package.


  3.5.8.  Database

  OJB <http://jakarta.apache.org/ojb/> is a database mapping tool that
  allows persistance and storage of Java objects in relational
  databases. Xindice <http://xml.apache.org/xindice/> is a native XML
  database for storing and querying XML documents.


  3.5.9.  Commons

  The Commons project <http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/> provides a
  great variety of reusable Java components with minimal dependencies.


  3.6.  Testing

  The following ASF projects cover testing and performance analisys.



  3.6.1.  httpd-test

  The httpd-test project <http://httpd.apache.org/test/> provides a
  testing framework for the Apache web server and tools such as flood
  <http://httpd.apache.org/test/flood/> for HTTP load testing.


  3.6.2.  Cactus

  Cactus <http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/> is a testing framework for
  testing server side Java code such as Servlets and EJBs.


  3.6.3.  JMeter

  This is a testing tool written in Java with a GUI frontend. It can be
  obtained at .


  3.6.4.  Lakta

  Lakta <http://jakarta.apache.org/lakta/> is an end-to-end HTTP testing
  tool


  3.6.5.  Watchdog
