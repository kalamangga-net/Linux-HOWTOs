  This is the Meta-FAQ for Linux.  It is mainly a list of valuable
  sources of information.  Check these sources out if you want to learn
  more about Linux, or have problems and need help.

  1.  Introduction


     What is Linux?
        Linux is an independent implementation of the POSIX operating
        system specification, with SYSV and BSD extensions, that has
        been written entirely from scratch (this means it looks and acts
        just like Unix).  It has no proprietary code in it.  Linux is
        freely distributable under the GNU General Public License.

        Linux works on IBM PC compatibles with an ISA or EISA bus
        (including local bus variants VLB and PCI) and a 386 or higher
        processor.  Some Amiga and Atari computers with MMU's are also
        supported.  This means 68020 with an external MMU, 68030, 68040,
        or 68060.  Support for the Digital Alpha is now stable.  Red Hat
        and Craftworks have Alpha distributions of Linux.  Support for
        Sparc is stable, and Red Hat Linux is available for Sparc.
        Support for PowerPC is in development for multiple platforms,
        including Nubus and PCI Macintosh, Motorola Powerstack, IBM 830
        and 850, and other platforms.  Support for ARM, StrongARM, and
        MIPS is in various stages of completion, but don't hold your
        breath.  Read comp.os.linux.announce instead.

        See the Linux INFO-SHEET for more technical information on these
        ports, and the Hardware Compatibility HOWTO for more exact
        hardware requirements.

        The Linux kernel is written by Linus Torvalds
        <torvalds@transmeta.com> and other volunteers.  Most of the
        programs running under Linux are generic Unix freeware, many of
        them from the GNU project.


     The Linux INFO-SHEET
        More specific technical information on Linux.  Includes pointers
        to information on the various ports, a feature list, information
        about how to get Linux, and more.


     The Linux HOWTO's
        These are somewhat like FAQ's, but instead of answering common
        questions, they explain how to do common tasks, like ordering a
        release of Linux, setting up print services under Linux, setting
        up a basic UUCP feed, etc.  See
        <http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX.html> or
        <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/> for the definitive
        versions of all the HOWTO's.  Other sites with up-to-date copies
        of the HOWTOs are ftp.cc.gatech.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu.

        In addition, there are many short, free-form documents called
        "mini-HOWTOs".  These documents cover very specific subjects,
        such as BogoMIPS or Color-ls.  These are available at
        <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini/> and at
        <http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX.html>.


     Linux newsgroups
        There are several Usenet newsgroups for Linux.  It is a good
        idea to follow at least comp.os.linux.announce if you use Linux.
        comp.os.linux.announce is moderated by Lars Wirzenius.  To make
        submissions to the newsgroup, send mail to linux-
        announce@news.ornl.gov.  You may direct questions about
        comp.os.linux.announce to Lars Wirzenius <wirzeniu@iki.fi>

        The newsgroup comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated newsgroup
        for announcements about Linux (new programs, bug fixes, etc).

        The newsgroup comp.os.linux.answers is a moderated newsgroup to
        which the Linux FAQ, HOWTO documents, and other documentation
        postings are made.

        The newsgroup comp.os.linux.setup is an unmoderated newsgroup
        for discussion of issues and problems involved in setting up
        Linux systems.

        The newsgroup comp.os.linux.admin is an unmoderated newsgroup
        for discussion of administration of Linux systems.

        The newsgroup comp.os.linux.development.system is an unmoderated
        newsgroup specifically for discussion of Linux kernel
        development.  The only application development questions that
        should be discussed here are those that are intimately
        associated with the kernel.  All other development questions are
        probably generic Unix development questions and should be
        directed to a comp.unix group instead, unless they are very
        Linux-specific applications questions, in which case they should
        be directed at comp.os.linux.development.apps.

        The newsgroup comp.os.linux.development.apps is an unmoderated
        newsgroup specifically for discussion of Linux-related
        applications development.  It is not for discussion of where to
        get applications for Linux, nor a discussion forum for those who
        would like to see applications for Linux.

        The newsgroup comp.os.linux.hardware is for Linux-specific
        hardware questions.

        The newsgroup comp.os.linux.networking is for Linux-specific
        networking development and setup questions.

        The newsgroup comp.os.linux.x is for Linux-specific X Windows
        questions.

        The newsgroup comp.os.linux.misc is an unmoderated newsgroup for
        any Linux discussion that doesn't belong anywhere else.

        In general, do not crosspost between the Linux newsgroups.  The
        only crossposting that is appropriate is an occasional posting
        between one unmoderated group and comp.os.linux.announce.  The
        whole point of splitting the old comp.os.linux group into many
        groups was to reduce traffic in each.  Those that do not follow
        this rule will be flamed without mercy...


     Other newsgroups
        Do not assume that all your questions are appropriate for a
        Linux newsgroup just because you are running Linux.  Is your
        question really about shell programming under any unix or unix
        clone?  Then ask in comp.unix.shell.  Is it about GNU Emacs?
        Then try asking in gnu.emacs.help.  Also, if you don't know
        another group to ask in, but think there might be, politely ask
        in your post if there is another group that would be more
        appropriate for your question.  At least the groups
        comp.unix.{questions,shell,programming,bsd,admin} and
        comp.windows.x.i386unix should be useful for a Linux user.

     Linux Journal
        A magazine called Linux Journal was launched several years ago.
        It includes articles intended for almost all skill levels, and
        is intended to be helpful to all Linux users.  Subscriptions are
        $22 in the U.S., $27 in Canada and Mexico, and $32 elsewhere
        around the world, all payable in U.S. funds. Subscription
        inquiries can be sent via email to subs@ssc.com or faxed to
        (U.S.)  1-206-782-7191 or mailed to Linux Journal, PO Box 85867,
        Seattle, WA 98145-1867 USA.  SSC has a PGP public key if you
        wish to send your credit card number via encrypted email: finger

  2.  Getting Linux

  2.1.  Linux FTP sites

  A more complete list of Linux FTP sites is in the Linux INFO-SHEET,
  which can always be found at <http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/INFO-
  SHEET.html> The most important sites are listed here; please see the
  INFO-SHEET for a site nearer to you (there are many mirrors).



       textual name             numeric addr    Linux directory
       =======================  ==============  ===============
       tsx-11.mit.edu           18.86.0.44      /pub/linux
       sunsite.unc.edu          152.2.22.81     /pub/Linux
       ftp.kernel.org           206.184.214.34  /pub/linux




  These sites are the main ``home'' sites for Linux where most uploads
  take place. There are many mirror sites; please use the closest
  (network-wise) site to you.


  2.2.  Linux on physical media

  Linux is distributed on physical media, mainly CD-ROM, by several
  commercial vendors.  Please read the distribution HOWTO, posted
  regularily to comp.os.linux.announce, and available at
  <http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Distribution-HOWTO.html>


  2.3.  AFS

  Linux is available over AFS by mounting the volume project.linux from
  sipb.mit.edu
  2.4.  Commercial networks

  Compu$erve has some Linux archives.


  2.5.  Mailservers and such

  Unfortunately SunSITE no longer does ftpmail.  Sorry.


  3.  Linux distributions

  Linux is distributed by its author only as a kernel.  Other people
  have put together ``distributions'' that pair the Linux kernel with
  utilities and application software to make a complete working package.

  There are several distributions of Linux, which are available at
  various sites.  Sunsite mirrors many of the distributions at
  <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/>.  The most commonly-
  recommended freely-available distributions are Red Hat
  <http://www.redhat.com> and Debian  <http://www.debian.org>.  These
  are available for free over the internet, and are also sold on CD-ROM.

  There are other distributions of Linux as well. Most commercial
  distributors of Linux advertise in Linux Journal.


  4.  Linux mailing-lists

  Used mostly for discussion between developers of new features and
  testers of pre-release versions.  See addresses in the FAQ.  Send mail
  to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the single word help in the body of
  the message , and you will get mail explaining how to subscribe to the
  many Linux mailing lists there.  Save this mail, as it tells you how
  to unsubscribe from the lists, and if you post annoying messages to
  the list complaining about not being able to get off the list (because
  you didn't follow instructions and save the mail telling you how to
  unsubscribe), you will likely be flamed for wasting international
  bandwidth and money.


  5.  Documentation for various programs

  Many programs come with some sort of documentation, often in a file
  called README or something similar.  It is a VERY good idea to read
  them with care.  It is boring to see (and answer) questions that are
  answered in the documentation.  Most programs also have ``man pages'';
  use the command man programname to get documentation on a program
  named programname.  To get help using the man program, use man man.

  Most distributions put other documentation about programs in the
  directory /usr/doc/; your distribution should include documentation on
  how to access that documentation.


  6.  More Documentation

  The Linux Documentation Project is working on a lot of documentation.
  Already, over 3000 pages of book-style documentation has been released
  to the general public, and another 2000 or so printed pages of man
  pages have also been released, with more to follow.  Check
  <http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/> for documents written by the LDP.




  7.  Keeping track of current releases

  Important new releases, programs, and ports are usually announced in
  comp.os.linux.announce.
