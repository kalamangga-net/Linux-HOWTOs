  v2.12, 2001-12-03

  This document describes how to setup an Intranet using Linux as the
  server which binds Unix, Netware, NT and Windows together. Hence by
  just establishing the connection to the Linux box you are provided
  transparent access to all the various platforms. Detailed explanations
  are provided for setting up HTTP using the NCSA server and connect to
  it using TCP/IP clients from Novell, Microsoft under Windows3.1,
  WFWG,Win95 and WinNT and MacTCP on the Apple PowerMac.

  1.  Introduction

  In simple terms, the Intranet is the descriptive term being used for
  the implementation of Internet technologies within a corporate
  organisation, rather than for external connection to the global
  Internet. This implementation is performed in such a way as to
  transparently deliver the immense informational resources of an
  organisation to each individuals desktop with minimal cost, time and
  effort. This document attempts to explain in simple terms how to setup
  an Intranet using tools which are readily available and are generally
  costing little or are free.

  This document assumes that you already know how to install TCP/IP on
  your Linux server and connect it physically to your LAN using an
  Ethernet network card. This also assumes you have some basic knowledge
  of Netware, WinNT and Mac systems. The configuration of the Netware
  server has been shown using version 3.1x as the basis. You can also
  use INETCFG to achieve the same result. On the client side the
  discussion is with respect to Windows 3.1x, Windows for Workgroups and
  Win95, WinNT and the Apple PowerMac.

  I am using the private network addresses (RFC-1918) of 172.16.0.0 and
  172.17.0.0 only as examples. You may choose suitable addresses
  depending on your configuration.

  2.  Install the HTTP server

  When you download the server you have two options: To get the source
  and compile it yourself, or get the precompiled binaries. The
  precompiled binaries for Linux (ELF) version are available at NCSA but
  not the older versions.


  2.1.  Preparation before downloading

  The server at NCSA will guide you through the steps for configuration
  options and prepare the various files for you. But before you attempt
  to download HTTPd be prepared with answers to the following questions


  2.1.1.  The Operating System

  First, you must choose whether to download the source or a pre-
  compiled version of the software. If your particular system doesn't
  appear in the menu, then you will have to get the default source, and
  compile it yourself.

  To check the version of your Linux go to the command prompt on your
  Linux machine and type


         linux:~$  uname -a



  which will respond with a line which looks similar to this


          linux:~$  uname -a
          Linux linux 2.0.29 #4 Tue Sep 13 04:05:51 CDT 1994 i586
          linux:~$



  The version of Linux is 2.0.29.

  The remaining parameters can be specified before downloading or
  configured later by modifying the file srm.conf in the
  /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf directory. The names of the actual
  directives that appear in the file httpd.conf are shown in brackets.
  The only exception is the directive DocumentRoot which appears in the
  file srm.conf

  2.1.2.  Process type (ServerType)

  This specifies how your machine will run your HTTPd server. The
  preferred method is "standalone". This makes the HTTP daemon to be
  running constantly. If you choose to load HTTPd under "inetd", the
  server binary will be reloaded into memory for every request, which
  may slow your server down.


  2.1.3.  Binding Port (Port)

  This specifies which port of your machine that the HTTPd daemon will
  bind to and listen for HTTP requests. If you can login as "root", use
  the default setting of 80.  Otherwise choose a setting between 1025
  and 65535.


  2.1.4.  Server user identity (User)

  This is the user id the server will change to when answering requests
  and acting on files.This question needs to be answered only if you are
  running the server as "standalone".  If you are someone without root
  permissions, just use your own login name. If you are system
  administrator, you might want to create a special user so you can
  control file permissions.


  2.1.5.  Server group identity (Group)

  This is the group id the server will change to when answering requests
  and acting on files. This is similar to Server User identity and is
  applicable only if you are running the server as standalone.

  If you do not have root permissions, just use the name of your primary
  group. You can find out your group by typing groups at the Linux
  command prompt.


  2.1.6.  Server administrator email address (ServerAdmin)

  This is the email address that the user should send an email message
  to when reporting a problem with the server. You can put your personal
  e-mail address.


  2.1.7.  Location of server directory (ServerRoot)

  This is where the server resides on your system. If you have root
  permissions leave it in its recommended location /usr/local/etc/httpd.
  If you cannot login as root, choose a subdirectory in your home path.
  You can find out the path of your home directory with the pwd command.


  2.1.8.  Location of HTML files (DocumentRoot)

  This is where the HTML files to be served are located. The default
  location is /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs.  You could however set it to
  be the home directory of the special user you chose in Server user
  identity, or a subdirectory in your home directory if you can't login
  as root.

  When in doubt, use the default settings. Now that you have answers to
  the above questions you can Download NCSA HTTPd at
  http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/setup/OneStep.html.  You should read
  the HTTPd Documentation at http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/ before
  you attempt installation. If you are planning to compile the code then
  you need to modify the makefiles in each of the th ree directories
  support, src, cgi-src. If your version of Linux is already supported
  then you just have to type make linux at the top level directory (i.e.
  /usr/local/etc/httpd)


  2.2.  Compiling HTTPd

  Compiling is simple, just type make linux at the prompt in the server
  root directory.  Note: Users of pre-ELF Linux have to uncomment
  #define NO_PASS in file portability.h and set DBM_LIBS= -ldbm in the
  Makefile before compiling HTTPd.


  3.  Testing HTTPd

  After you have installed HTTPd, login as root and start it by typing
  httpd & . (assuming you have installed as standalone) You should now
  be able to see it in the list generated by ps. The simplest way to
  test HTTPd is by Telnet. At the Linux command prompt type


          linux:~$  telnet 172.16.0.1 80



  where 80 is the default port for HTTP. If you have configured "Port"
  as something different then type that number instead. You should get a
  response which looks like this


          Trying 172.16.0.1...
          Connected to linux.mydomain.
          Escape character is '^]'.



  Now if you type in any character and press Enter you should get a
  response similar to the one shown below.


          HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request
          Date: Wed, 10 Jan 1996 10:24:37 GMT
          Server: NCSA/1.5
          Content-type: text/html

          <HEAD><TITLE>400 Bad Request < /TITLE> < /HEAD>
          <BODY><H1>400 Bad Request < /H1>
          Your client sent a query that this server could
          not understand.<P>
          Reason: Invalid or unsupported method.<P>
          < /BODY>



  Now we are ready to connect to this server using another PC and a WWW
  Browser.


  4.  Connecting to the Linux Server

  Please refer to the diagram shown in the chapter ``Introduction'' for
  the addressing scheme used. Workstation 1 (W/S1) is on network
  172.16.0.0 and can access the Linux server directly whereas
  Workstation 2 (W/S2) is on network 172.17.0.0 and needs to use the
  gateway (router) 172.17.0.254 to access the Linux box. This gateway
  information needs to be provided while configuring the clients only on
  W/S2. Netware refers to the gateway as 'ip_router'.

  I am using W/S2 to illustrate the client setup. To setup W/S1 just
  change the address 172.17.0.5 to 172.16.0.5 and ignore all references
  to the gateway/router.

  If you do not have a router you can skip the next section and proceed
  to

  ·  ``Setup Netware Server'' if you use a Netware server.

  ·  ``Setup MS Windows Client'' if you use the Microsoft Client.


  4.1.  Setup the Linux server

  You may skip this section if you do not have a router.

  You have to configure the Linux server to recognise the router thus
  allowing Workstation 2 to connect to the Web server. In order to setup
  the Linux server you should login as root. At the server prompt type


          route add gw default 172.16.0.254



  To use this gateway everytime you boot the Linux server edit the file
  /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 and change the line containing the gateway defini­
  tion to GATEWAY = "172.16.0.254". Make sure the line for adding the
  gateway is not commented out.

  ALT: You can add routes to the networks on the other side of the
  router. This would be done as


          route add -net 172.17.0.0 gw 172.16.0.254



  To add this route everytime you boot Linux add the command to your
  /etc/rc.d/rc.local file.



  4.2.  Setup the Netware server

  In order to setup the Netware server you should have Supervisor
  permissions or atleast Console operator permissions. If these cannot
  be got, try asking your Network Administrator to help you with the
  setup.  At the Server enable the Ethernet_II frame type on the LAN by
  typing these commands or include them in the AUTOEXEC.ncf file.


          load NE2000 frame=Ethernet_II name=IPNET
          load TCPIP
          bind IP to IPNET addr=172.16.0.2 mask=FF.FF.FF.0



  You might have to specify the slot or board number while loading the
  NE2000 driver depending on your machine configuration. (eg: load
  NE2000 slot=3 frame=.....)


  4.3.  Setup the Netware Client

  On the PC you have the choice of Win3.1,WFWG or Win95. The
  installation procedure differs between Win95 and the older windows if
  you are using the 32bit client from Microsoft or Novell. If you are
  going to use the 16bit client, the procedure is the same and you can
  refer to the Windows 3.x installation instructions. For installing the
  32bit client for Win95 skip to ``Windows 95 installation''.


  4.3.1.  Windows 3.x

  If you are using Win3.1 or WFWG you can install the Netware Client
  (VLMs) and some additional files which are provided with the TCP/IP
  diskette, namely

  TCPIP.exe, VTCPIP.386, WINSOCK.dll and WLIBSOCK.dll

  Note that the WINSOCK.dll file is different from the ones provided
  with Win95 and Trumpet. Install the Netware Client with the support
  for windows. Copy VTCPIP.386, WINSOCK.dll and WLIBSOCK.dll to the
  SYSTEM directory and TCPIP.exe to the NWCLIENT directory. Now modify
  the STARTNET.bat in the NWCLIENT directory to


          lsl
          ne2000     ---> your network card driver
          c:\windows\odihlp.exe     ---->if you are using WFWG
          ipxodi
          tcpip        ---> add this line
          nwip         ---> if you use Netware/IP
          vlm



  Create a subdirectory (say) \NET\TCP and copy the files HOSTS,
  NETWORKS, PROTOCOLS and SERVICES from /etc on your Linux server or the
  directory SYS:ETC on your Netware server. Edit the copied HOSTS file
  to add the line for your new Linux server. This will enable you to
  refer to the Linux server as http://linux.mydomain/ instead of
  http://172.16.0.1/in your WWW browser


          127.0.0.1      localhost
          172.16.0.1      linux.mydomain



  Edit the NET.cfg file in NWCLIENT directory



     Link Driver NE2000
         port 300
         int 3
         MEM D0000
         FRAME Ethernet_802.2

  ; ---- add these lines ----

        FRAME Ethernet_II

     Protocol TCPIP
        PATH TCP_CFG C:\NET\TCP
        ip_address  172.17.0.5
        ip_netmask  255.255.255.0
        ip_router   172.17.0.254     ---> add the address of your gateway only
                                    ---> if you have to use this
                                    ---> gateway to reach your HTTP server

     Link Support
        MemPool 6192       ---> the minimum is 1024. Try with different values
        Buffers 10 1580    ---> this again can be fine tuned

  ;---------------------------------
  ; You may need to add lines like these if you are using Netware/IP
  ;
     NWIP
        NWIP_DOMAIN_NAME  mydomain
        NSQ_BROADCAST   ON
        NWIP1_1 COMPATIBILITY   OFF
        AUTORETRIES     1
        AUTORETRY SECS  10



  Edit the SYSTEM.ini file in the WINDOWS directory and add this entry
  for VTCPIP.386


          [386Enh]
          .....
          network=*vnetbios, vipx.386, vnetware.386, VTCPIP.386
          .....



  Reboot your PC, run STARTNET.bat and you can now use your favorite WWW
  browser to access your Web pages. You need not login to Netware and
  you don't have to run TCPMAN (if you use Trumpet Winsock).


  4.3.2.  Windows 95

  This section explains how to install the 32bit client on Win95.
  Firstly you must install the following


          Client for Netware Networks (from Microsoft or Novell)
          Microsoft TCP/IP Protocol
          Network Adapter



  To install these items, click on My Computer, Control Panel, Networks.
  Click Add. You will now be in a window that displays Client, Adapter,
  Protocol and Service.  To install the Client for Netware Networks:


         1. DoubleClick on Client
         2. Click on Microsoft or Novell
         3. DoubleClick on Client for Netware Networks



  To install the TCP/IP Protocol:


         1. DoubleClick on Protocol
         2. Click on Microsoft
         3. DoubleClick on TCP/IP



  Windows 95 by default installs several other protocols automatically.
  Remove them by clicking on them and clicking the Remove button.
  Typically Win95 installs the Microsoft NetBeui protocol, and IPX/SPX
  compatible protocol. You can delete the NetBEUI protocol, but you will
  need the IPX/SPX protocol if you wish to login to the Netware Server.

  To setup TCP/IP click on TCP/IP, click on Properties, click on the tab
  IP address


         Enter your IP address in the "Specify an IP address "
                               box as 172.17.0.5
         In the Subnet Mask box enter 255.255.255.0



  select the tab Gateway


         Enter your gateway (router) address in the box New gateway
            as 172.17.0.254
         Click the Add button



  The gateway address should now appear under the installed gateways
  box. Now Click OK.

  You should get a message to reboot. Do so. You should now be able to
  use the Browser to connect to your HTTP Server.


  4.4.  Setup Microsoft Client

  If you are using the Microsoft Client for accessing your network, then
  this section details how to install TCP/IP for

  ·  ``Windows for Workgroups (WFWG)''

  ·  ``Windows 95''


  ·  ``Windows NT 4.0''

     Note: To enable you to refer to the Linux server as
     http://linux.mydomain/ instead of http://172.16.0.1/ in the WWW
     browser and all your intranet commands you need to edit the hosts
     file. You can add more entries for each of your other hosts
     (Netware, Unix, WinNT) as well. The Windows family keeps its HOSTS
     file in \WINDOWS or in \WINDOWS\SYSTEM depending on the version.
     Edit this file and add a line for your Linux server as:


          127.0.0.1      localhost
          172.16.0.1     linux.mydomain

          172.16.0.2     netware.mydomain
          172.16.0.3     winNT.mydomain
          172.16.0.5     ws_1



  4.4.1.  Windows for Workgroups

  This section explains how to install the 32bit client on WFWG. Firstly
  you must download the TCP/IP drivers for Windows from Microsoft. The
  current version is 3.11b and is available at ftp://ftp.microsoft.com
  or other sites as tcp32b.exe. Make sure that you have load Win32s
  before trying to load the TCP/IP-32bit driver.

  Having expanded the TCP/IP files into a temporary directory (say
  C:\TEMP), check your \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory for copies of
  OEMSETUP.INF. If there are any, rename them. Now copy the OEMSETUP.INF
  file from the TEMP directory to the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. If you
  have loaded any other TCP/IP stacks on your system, please remove them
  before you proceed.

  Start Network Setup or Windows Setup/Change Network settings


           Click the Networks button
           Click Install Microsoft Windows Network.
             Choose support for additional networks (if required)
           Click OK



  You should be prompted for your network adapter - select the appropri­
  ate one. If you are not prompted, then


            Click the Adapter button
                select an adapter (say NE2000)
                Click OK
            Click the Protocol button
                select the MS TCP/IP-32 protocol
                click OK



  You will now be prompted to configure the TCP/IP protocol stack. You
  can always reconfigure this by highlighting the TCP/IP protocol shown
  in the box Adapters and clicking the Setup button.

     In the IP address box enter 172.17.0.5
     In the Subnet Mask box enter 255.255.255.0
     Enter your gateway (router) address in the box default gateway
       as 172.17.0.254



  Click OK. The computer will ask you to restart. Do so. You should now
  be able to use the Browser to connect to your HTTP Server.


  4.4.2.  Windows 95

  This section explains how to install the 32bit client for Microsoft on
  Win95. Firstly you must install the following


          Client for Microsoft Networks
          Microsoft TCP/IP Protocol
          Network Adapter



  To install these items, click on My Computer, Control Panel, Networks.
  Click Add. You will now be in a window that displays Client, Adapter,
  Protocol and Service.  To install the Client for Microsoft Networks:


         1. DoubleClick on Client
         2. Click on Microsoft
         3. DoubleClick on Client for Microsoft Networks



  To install the TCP/IP Protocol:


         1. DoubleClick on Protocol
         2. Click on Microsoft
         3. DoubleClick on TCP/IP



  Windows 95 by default installs several protocols automatically. Remove
  them by clicking on them and clicking the Remove button. Typically
  Win95 installs the Microsoft NetBeui protocol.

  To setup TCP/IP click on TCP/IP, click on Properties, click on the tab
  IP address


         Enter your IP address in the "Specify an IP address "
                               box as 172.17.0.5
         In the Subnet Mask box enter 255.255.255.0



  select the tab Gateway

  Browser to connect to your HTTP Server.


  4.5.  Setup TCP/IP on Macintosh

  If you are using the Macintosh for accessing your network, then this
  section details how to install MacTCP for the PowerMacs.

  Note: To enable you to refer to the Linux server as
  http://linux.mydomain/ instead of http://172.16.0.1/ in the WWW
  browser and all your intranet commands you need to edit the hosts
  file. The format of the hosts file is different from the one used in
  Unix. The Mac hosts file is based on RFC-1035. You can add more
  entries for each of your other hosts (Netware, Unix, WinNT) as well.
  The MacOS  keeps its HOSTS file in the Preferences folder under the
  System folder. Edit this file and add a line for your Linux server as:


         linux.mydomain    A  172.16.0.1

         netware.mydomain  A  172.16.0.2
         winNT.mydomain    A  172.16.0.3
         ws_1              A  172.16.0.5



  4.5.1.  MacTCP

  This section explains how to install MacTCP. Firstly you must download
  the MacTCP files from Apple or install it from the Internet Connection
  CD.  To configure MacTCP, click the Apple Menu/ Control Panels/
  TCP/IP. In the screen change the setting for 'Connect via:' to
  'Ethernet'

  Change the 'Configure' setting to 'Manually'


         In the IP address box enter 172.17.0.5
         In the Subnet Mask box enter 255.255.255.0
         Enter your gateway (router) address in the box
           Router address as 172.17.0.254



  Click OK. You should now be able to use the Browser to connect to your
  HTTP Server.



  5.  Setting up the Intranet

  An Intranet cannot be complete without sharing the resources on the
  different platforms. You will need support for other filesystems, so
  that you can access the data available on them. This document provides
  instructions to connect Linux to the following popular filesystems.

  ·  ``NCP filesystem for Netware''

  ·  ``SMB filesystem for Windows''

  ·  ``NFS filesystem for Unix''

  These filesystems can be compiled into the Linux kernel or added as
  modules, depending on the version of Linux. If you are not familiar
  with compiling the kernel you can refer to the Kernel HOWTO
  http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html and the Module
  HOWTO http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Module-HOWTO.html for compiling
  the kernel with modules.



  5.1.  NCPFS

  To share the files on the Netware server you will need support for NCP
  (ncpfs). NCPFS works with kernel version 1.2.x and 1.3.71 upwards. It
  does not work with any earlier 1.3.x kernel. It cannot access the NDS
  database in Netware 4.x, but can make use of the bindery. If you are
  using Netware 4.x you can enable bindery support for specific
  containers using the command Set Bindery Context at the console as:



         set Bindery Context = CORP.MYDOM;WEBUSER.MYDOM



  In the above example two containers have bindery support enabled.

  You will need to download the NCP filesystem utilities using the URL
  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/ncpfs/ncpfs.tgz
  (currently ncpfs-2.0.10) from Sunsite.


  5.1.1.  Installation

  To install the ncpfs utilities, type


          zcat ncpfs.tgz | tar xvf -



  to expand the files into its own directory. In this case you will get
  a directory ncpfs-2.0.10 Change your directory to this ncpfs directory
  before proceeding with the installation. Read the README and edit the
  Makefile if necessary.

  The installation of ncpfs depends on the kernel version you are using.
  For kernel 1.2, you should simply type 'make'. Subsequently typing
  'make install' will install the executables and man pages.

  If you use Kernel 1.3.71 or later, you might have to recompile your
  kernel. With these kernels, the kernel part of ncpfs is already
  included in the main source tree. To check if the kernel needs to be
  recompiled type


          cat /proc/filesystems



  It should show you a line saying that the kernel knows ncpfs.

  If ncpfs is not there, you can either recompile the kernel or add
  ncpfs as a module. For recompiling the kernel you should type 'make
  config' and when it asks you for

  The IPX protocol (CONFIG_IPX) [N/y/?]

  simply answer 'y'. Probably you do not need the full internal net that
  you are asked for next. Once the kernel is successfully installed,
  reboot, check /proc/filesystems and if everything is OK proceed with
  the installation of the ncpfs utilities. Change directory to the
  location holding your downloaded ncpfs files, and type 'make'. After
  the compilation is finished type 'make install' to install the various
  utilities and man pages.


  5.1.2.  Mounting NCPFS

  To check the installation type


          ipx_configure --auto_interface=on --auto_primary=on

       ....wait for 10 seconds and type

          slist



  You should be able to see a list of your Netware servers. Now we are
  ready to share files from the Netware server.

  Suppose we need to access HTML files from directory \home\htmldocs on
  volume VOL1: on the server MYDOM_NW, I recommend that you create a new
  user (say) 'EXPORT' with password 'EXP123' on this server to whom you
  grant appropriate access rights to this directory using SYSCON or
  NWADMIN.

  On the Linux machine create a new directory /mnt/MYDOM_NW. Now type
  the command


          ncpmount -S MYDOM_NW -U EXPORT -P EXP123 /mnt/MYDOM_NW



  to mount the netware file system. Typing the command


          ls /mnt/MYDOM_NW/vol1/home/htmldocs



  will show you a list of all the files in MYDOM_NW/VOL1:\HOME\HTMLDOCS
  (using Netware file notation). If you have any problems please read
  the IPX HOWTO at http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/IPX-HOWTO.html for
  more insights into the IPX system.



  5.2.  SMBFS

  To share the files on the Windows server you will need support for SMB
  (smbfs).

  You will need to download the SMB filesystem utilities from
  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/smbfs/smbfs.tgz
  (currently smbfs-2.0.1) from Sunsite.


  5.2.1.  Installation

  To install the smbfs utilities, type


          zcat smbfs.tgz | tar xvf -



  to expand the files into its own directory. In this case you will get
  a directory smbfs-2.0.1 Change your directory to this smbfs directory
  before proceeding with the installation. Read the README and edit the
  Makefile if necessary.

  The installation of smbfs depends on the kernel version you are using.
  For kernel 1.2, you should simply type 'make'. Subsequently typing
  'make install' will install the executables and man pages.

  If you use Kernel 2.0 or later, you might have to recompile your
  kernel. With these kernels, the kernel part of smbfs is already
  included in the main source tree. To check if the kernel needs to be
  recompiled type


          cat /proc/filesystems



  It should show you a line saying that the kernel knows smbfs.

  If smbfs is not there, you can either recompile the kernel or add
  smbfs as a module. For recompiling the kernel you should type 'make
  config' and when it asks you for adding SMB filesystem support simply
  answer yes. Once the kernel is successfully installed, reboot, check
  /proc/filesystems and if everything is OK proceed with the
  installation of the smbfs utilities. Change directory to the location
  holding your downloaded smbfs files, and type 'make'. After the
  compilation is finished type 'make install' to install the various
  utilities and man pages.


  5.2.2.  Mounting SMBFS

  In our example let us assume that the WinNT server is called
  'MYDOM_NT' and is sharing its directory C:\PUB\HTMLDOCS with a share
  name of 'HTMLDOCS' without a password. On the Linux machine create a
  new directory /mnt/MYDOM_NT. Now type the command


          smbmount //MYDOM_NT/HTMLDOCS /mnt/MYDOM_NT -n



  to mount the SMB (windows share) file system. If this does not work
  try


          smbmount //MYDOM_NT/COMMON /mnt/MYDOM_NT -n -I 172.16.0.3



  Typing the command


          ls /mnt/MYDOM_NT



  will show you a list of all the files in bsol;bsol;MYDOM_NT\PUB\HTML­
  DOCS (using Windows file notation).

  5.3.  NFS

  First you will need a kernel with the NFS file system either compiled
  in or available as a module.

  Suppose you have a Unix host running NFS with the name MYDOM_UNIX and
  an IP address of 172.16.0.4. You can check the directories that are
  being exported (shared) by this host by typing the command



          showmount -e 172.16.0.4



  Once we know the exported directories you can mount them by entering a
  appropriate mount command. I recommend that you create a subdirectory
  under '/mnt' (say) 'MYDOM_UNIX' and use that as your mount point.



          mount -o rsize=1024,wsize=1024 172.16.0.4:/pub/htmldocs /mnt/MYDOM_UNIX



  The rsize and wsize may have to be changed depending on your environ­
  ment.

  If you have any problems please read the NFS HOWTO at
  http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/NFS-HOWTO.html for more insights into
  the NFS system.



  6.  Accessing the Web

  Now that we have setup the HTTP server, the clients and interconnected
  the Linux server with the other servers, we need to make some small
  adjustments on the Linux server to be able to access these mounted
  filesystems from the Web Browser.


  6.1.  Accessing the mounted filesystems

  To access the mounted directories in your HTML pages you have two
  methods:

  ·  Create a link in DocumentRoot (/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs) to
     refer to the mounted directory as


          ln -s /mnt/MYDOM_NW/vol1/home/htmldocs netware
                            or

          ln -s /mnt/MYDOM_NT    winNT
                            or

          ln -s /mnt/MYDOM_UNIX    unix



  ·  to edit the file srm.conf in your /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf
     directory and add a new alias.
         # Alias fakename realname
         Alias /icons/     /usr/local/etc/httpd/icons/

         # alias for netware server
         Alias /netware/   /mnt/MYDOM_NW/vol1/home/htmldocs/
         Alias /winNT/     /mnt/MYDOM_NT/
         Alias /unix/      /mnt/MYDOM_UNIX



  And restart your HTTPd. You can access the documents on the netware
  server by referring to them as http://linux.mydomain/netware/index.htm
  for the netware files and similar notations for the others.


  6.2.  Connecting to the Internet

  You can finally connect your Intranet to the Internet to access E-Mail
  and all the wonderful information out there. I propose to write a
  brief note on how to do this in a future revision. Detailed
  explanations are available in the ISP Hookup HOWTO from
  http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/ISP-Hookup-HOWTO.html and Diald mini
  HOWTO at http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/Diald for setting up
  these connections.


  6.3.  Other uses

  The HTTP server can be used in the office to provide transparent
  access to information residing on different servers, at several
  locations and directories. The data can be simple documents in Word,
  Lotus spreadsheets, or complex databases.

  The application of this technology is being typically used as
  follows:-


  ·  Publishing corporate documents

     These documents can include newsletters, annual reports, maps,
     company facilities, price lists, product information literature,
     and any document which is of value within the corporate entity.

  ·  Access into searchable directories

     Rapid access to corporate phone books and the like. This data can
     be mirrored at a Web site or, via CGI scripts, the Web server can
     serve  as a gateway to back-end pre-existing or new applications.
     This means that, using the same standard access mechanisms,
     information can be made more widely available and in a simpler
     manner.  This means that it can be used to create an interface with
     RDBMS  like ORACLE and SYBASE for generating real-time information.
     Here is a list of links to such sites on the Web.

     - Web Access -
     http://cscsun1.larc.nasa.gov/~beowulf/db/web_access.html - CGI
     gateways - HTTP://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/RDBGate/Overview.html


  ·  Corporate/Department/Individual pages

     As cultures change within organistions to the point where even each
     department moves towards their own individual mission statements,
     the Intranet technology provides the ideal medium to communicate
     current information to the Department or Individual. Powerful
     search engines provide the means for people to find the group or
     individual who has the answers to the continuous questions which
     arise in the normal day-to-day course of doing business.

  ·  Simple Groupware applications

     With HTML forms support, sites can provide sign-up sheets, surveys
     and simple scheduling.

  ·  Software distribution

     Administrators can use the Intranet to deliver software and up-
     dates on-demand to users across the corporate network . This can be
     done with 'Java' which allows the creation and transparent
     distribution of objects on-demand rather than just data or
     applications. This is indeed possible more easily with the newer
     versions of Linux which has builtin support for Java.

  ·  Mail

     With the move to the use of Intranet mail products with standard
     and simple methods for attachment of documents, sound, vision and
     other multimedia between individuals, mail is being pushed further
     forward as a simple, de facto communications method. Mail is
     essentially individual to individual, or individual to small group,
     communication. Several utilities are available on the Linux
     platform to setup an E-mail system like sendmail, pop3d, imapd.


  ·  User Interface

     The Intranet technology is evolving so rapidly that the tools
     available, in particular HTML, can be used to dramatically change
     the way we interface with systems. With HTML you can build an
     Interface which is only limited by the creators imagination. The
     beauty about using Intranet technologies for this is that it is so
     simple. Clicking a hyperlink from HTML can take you to another
     page, it could ring an alarm, run a yearend procedure or anything
     else that a computer program can do.
