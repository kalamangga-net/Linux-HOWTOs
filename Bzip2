  1.  Introduction

  Bzip2 is a groovy new algorithm for compressing data.  It generally
  makes files that are 60-70% of the size of their gzip'd counterparts.


  This document will take you through a few common applications for
  bzip2.


  Future versions of the document will have applications of libbzip2,
  the bzip2 C library which bzip2's author, Julian Seward
  <mailto:Julian_Seward@muraroa.demon.co.uk> has kindly written.  The
  bzip2 manual, which includes low-level information about the library,
  can be found here <http://www.bzip2.org/bzip2/docs/manual_toc.html>.


  Future versions of the document may also include a summary of the
  discussion over whether (and how) bzip2 should be used in the Linux
  kernel.


  1.1.  Revision History

  1.1.1.  v2.00

  Changed the ``Using bzip2 with less'' section so .tar.bzip2 files can
  actually be read.  Thanks to Nicola Fabiano <mailto:mc8644@mclink.it>
  for the correction.

  Updated buzzit utility.

  Updated tar information.


  1.1.2.  v1.92

  Updated the ``Getting bzip2 binaries'' section, including adding
  S.u.S.E.'s.


  1.1.3.  v1.91

  Corrected a typo and clarified some shell idioms in the ``section on
  using bzip2 with tar''.  Thanks to Alessandro Rubini for these.


  Updated the buzzit tool not to stomp on the original bzip2 archive.


  Added bgrep, a zgrep-like tool.


  1.1.4.  v1.9

  Clarified the gcc 2.7.* problem.  Thanks to Ulrik Dickow for pointing
  this out.


  Added Leonard Jean-Marc's elegant way to work with tar.


  Added Linus Ãkerlund's Swedish translation.



  Fixed the wu-ftpd section per Arnaud Launay's suggestion.


  Moved translations to their own section.


  1.1.5.  v1.8

  Put buzzit and tar.diff in the sgml where they belong. Fixed
  punctuation and formatting.  Thanks to Arnaud Launay for his help
  correcting my copy. :-)


  Dropped xv project for now due to lack of popular interest.


  Added teasers for future versions of the document.


  1.1.6.  v1.7

  Added buzzit utility.  Fixed the patch against gnu tar.


  1.1.7.  v1.6

  (Also corrected jka-compr.el patch for emacs per his suggestion. Oops!
  Bzip2's doesn't yet(?) have an "append" flag.)


  1.1.11.  v1.2

  Changed patch for emacs so it automagically recognizes .bz2 files.


  1.1.12.  v1.1

  Added patch for emacs.

  2.  Getting bzip2

  Bzip2's home page is at The UK home site <http://www.bzip2.org/>.  The
  United States mirror site is here
  <http://www.digistar.com/bzip2/index.html>.


  2.1.  Bzip2-HOWTO in your language

  French speakers may wish to refer to Arnaud Launay's French documents.
  The web version is here
  <http://www.freenix.fr/linux/HOWTO/mini/Bzip2.html>, and you can use
  ftp here <ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/linux/french/docs/HOWTO/mini/Bzip2.gz>
  Arnaud can be contacted by electronic mail at this address
  <mailto:zoro@mygale.org>


  Japanese speakers may wish to refer to Tetsu Isaji's Japanese
  documents here <http://jf.gee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/JF/JF.html>.  Isaji can be
  reached at his home page <http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~kaien/>, or by
  electronic mail at this address. <mailto:isaji@mxu.meshnet.or.jp>


  Swedish speakers may wish to refer to Linus Ãkerlund's Swedish
  documents here <http://user.tninet.se/~uxm165t/linux_doc.html>.  Linus
  can be reached by electronic mail at this address.
  <mailto:uxm165t@tninet.se>


  2.2.  Getting bzip2 precompiled binaries

  See the home sites.


  2.3.  Getting bzip2 sources

  They come from the Official sites (see ``Getting Bzip2'' for where.


  2.4.  Compiling bzip2 for your machine

  If you have gcc 2.7.*, change the line that reads


       CFLAGS = -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops



  to


       CFLAGS = -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer



  that is, replace -O3 with -O2 and drop the -funroll-loops.  You may
  also wish to add  any -m* flags (like -m486, for example) you use when
  compiling kernels.

  Avoiding -funroll-loops is the most important part, since this will
  cause many gcc 2.7's to generate wrong code, and all gcc 2.7's to
  generate slower and larger code.  For other compilers (lcc, egcs, gcc
  2.8.x) the default CFLAGS are fine.

  After that, just make it and install it per the README.


  3.  Using bzip2 by itself

  Read the Fine Manual Page :)


  4.  Using bzip2 with tar

  Listed below are three ways to use bzip2 with tar, namely

  4.1.  Easiest to set up:

  This method requires no setup at all.  To un-tar the bzip2'd tar
  archive, foo.tar.bz2 in the current directory, do


       /path/to/bzip2 -cd foo.tar.bz2 | tar xf -



  or


       tar --use-compress-prog=bzip2 xf foo.tar.bz2



  These work, but can be a PITA to type often.


  4.2.  Easy to set up, fairly easy to use, no need for root privileges:

  Thanks to Leonard Jean-Marc <mailto:leonard@sct1.is.belgacom.be> for
  the tip.  Thanks also to Alessandro Rubini
  <mailto:rubini@morgana.systemy.it> for differentiating bash from the
  csh's.


  In your .bashrc, you can put in a line like this:


       alias btar='tar --use-compress-program /usr/local/bin/bzip2 '



  In your .tcshrc, or .cshrc, the analogous line looks like this:


       alias btar 'tar --use-compress-program /usr/local/bin/bzip2'



  4.3.  Also easy to use, but needs root access.

  Update your tar to GNU's newest version, which is currently 1.13.10.
  It can be found at GNU's ftp site <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/tar/> or
  any mirror.
  5.  Using bzip2 with less

  To uncompress bzip2'd files on the fly, i.e. to be able to use "less"
  on them without first bunzip2'ing them, you can make a lesspipe.sh
  (man less) like this:

  #!/bin/sh
  # This is a preprocessor for 'less'.  It is used when this environment
  # variable is set:   LESSOPEN="|lesspipe.sh %s"

    case "$1" in
    *.tar) tar tvvf $1 2>/dev/null ;; # View contents of various tar'd files
    *.tgz) tar tzvvf $1 2>/dev/null ;;
  # This one work for the unmodified version of tar:
    *.tar.bz2) bzip2 -cd $1 $1 2>/dev/null | tar tvvf - ;;
  #This one works with the patched version of tar:
  # *.tar.bz2) tyvvf $1 2>/dev/null ;;
    *.tar.gz) tar tzvvf $1 2>/dev/null ;;
    *.tar.Z) tar tzvvf $1 2>/dev/null ;;
    *.tar.z) tar tzvvf $1 2>/dev/null ;;
    *.bz2) bzip2 -dc $1  2>/dev/null ;; # View compressed files correctly
    *.Z) gzip -dc $1  2>/dev/null ;;
    *.z) gzip -dc $1  2>/dev/null ;;
    *.gz) gzip -dc $1  2>/dev/null ;;
    *.zip) unzip -l $1 2>/dev/null ;;
    *.1|*.2|*.3|*.4|*.5|*.6|*.7|*.8|*.9|*.n|*.man) FILE=`file -L $1` ; # groff src
      FILE=`echo $FILE | cut -d ' ' -f 2`
      if [ "$FILE" = "troff" ]; then
        groff -s -p -t -e -Tascii -mandoc $1
      fi ;;
    *) cat $1 2>/dev/null ;;
  #  *) FILE=`file -L $1` ; # Check to see if binary, if so -- view with 'strings'
  #    FILE1=`echo $FILE | cut -d ' ' -f 2`
  #    FILE2=`echo $FILE | cut -d ' ' -f 3`
  #    if [ "$FILE1" = "Linux/i386" -o "$FILE2" = "Linux/i386" \
  #         -o "$FILE1" = "ELF" -o "$FILE2" = "ELF" ]; then
  #      strings $1
  #    fi ;;
    esac



  6.  Using bzip2 with emacs

  6.1.  Changing emacs for everyone:

  I've written the following patch to jka-compr.el which adds bzip2 to
  auto-compression-mode.

  Disclaimer: I have only tested this with emacs-20.2, but have no
  reason to believe that a similar approach won't work with other
  versions.

  To use it,

  1. Go to the emacs-20.2/lisp source directory (wherever you untarred
     it)

  2. Put the patch below in a file called jka-compr.el.diff (it should
     be alone in that file ;).

  3. Do



   patch < jka-compr.el.diff



  4. Start emacs, and do


        M-x byte-compile-file jka-compr.el



  5. Leave emacs.

  6. Move your original jka-compr.elc to a safe place in case of bugs.

  7. Replace it with the new jka-compr.elc.

  8. Have fun!

  6.2.  Changing emacs for one person:

  Thanks for this one go to Ulrik Dickow, ukd@kampsax.dk
  <mailto:ukdATkampsax.dk>, Systems Programmer at Kampsax Technology:

  To make it so you can use bzip2 automatically when you aren't the
  sysadmin, just add the following to your .emacs file.
  ;; Automatic (un)compression on loading/saving files (gzip(1) and similar)
  ;; We start it in the off state, so that bzip2(1) support can be added.

                nil t])
  (toggle-auto-compression 1 t)



  7.  Using bzip2 with wu-ftpd

  Thanks to Arnaud Launay for this bandwidth saver.  The following
  should go in /etc/ftpconversions to do on-the-fly compressions and
  decompressions with bzip2. Make sure that the paths (like
  /bin/compress) are right.


   :.Z:  :  :/bin/compress -d -c %s:T_REG|T_ASCII:O_UNCOMPRESS:UNCOMPRESS
   :   : :.Z:/bin/compress -c %s:T_REG:O_COMPRESS:COMPRESS
   :.gz: :  :/bin/gzip -cd %s:T_REG|T_ASCII:O_UNCOMPRESS:GUNZIP
   :   : :.gz:/bin/gzip -9 -c %s:T_REG:O_COMPRESS:GZIP
   :.bz2: :  :/bin/bzip2 -cd %s:T_REG|T_ASCII:O_UNCOMPRESS:BUNZIP2
   :   : :.bz2:/bin/bzip2 -9 -c %s:T_REG:O_COMPRESS:BZIP2
   :   : :.tar:/bin/tar -c -f - %s:T_REG|T_DIR:O_TAR:TAR

   :   : :.tar.gz:/bin/tar -c -z -f - %s:T_REG|T_DIR:O_COMPRESS|O_TAR:TAR+GZIP
   :   : :.tar.bz2:/bin/tar -c -y -f - %s:T_REG|T_DIR:O_COMPRESS|O_TAR:TAR+BZIP2



  8.  Using bzip2 with grep

  The following utility, which I call bgrep, is a slight modification of
  the zgrep which comes with Linux.  You can use it to grep through
  files without bunzip2'ing them first.



  #!/bin/sh

  # bgrep -- a wrapper around a grep program that decompresses files as needed
  PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"; export PATH

  prog=`echo $0 | sed 's|.*/||'`
  case "$prog" in
          *egrep) grep=${EGREP-egrep}     ;;
          *fgrep) grep=${FGREP-fgrep}     ;;
          *)      grep=${GREP-grep}       ;;
  esac
  pat=""
  while test $# -ne 0; do
    case "$1" in
    -e | -f) opt="$opt $1"; shift; pat="$1"
             if test "$grep" = grep; then  # grep is buggy with -e on SVR4
               grep=egrep
             fi;;
    -*)      opt="$opt $1";;
     *)      if test -z "$pat"; then
               pat="$1"
             else
               break;
             fi;;
    esac
    shift
  done

  if test -z "$pat"; then
    echo "grep through bzip2 files"
    echo "usage: $prog [grep_options] pattern [files]"
    exit 1
  fi

  list=0
  silent=0
  op=`echo "$opt" | sed -e 's/ //g' -e 's/-//g'`
  case "$op" in
    *l*) list=1
  esac
  case "$op" in
    *h*) silent=1
  esac

  if test $# -eq 0; then
    bzip2 -cd | $grep $opt "$pat"
    exit $?
  fi

  res=0
  for i do
    if test $list -eq 1; then
      bzip2 -cdfq "$i" | $grep $opt "$pat" > /dev/null && echo $i
      r=$?
    elif test $# -eq 1 -o $silent -eq 1; then
      bzip2 -cd "$i" | $grep $opt "$pat"
      r=$?
    else
      bzip2 -cd "$i" | $grep $opt "$pat" | sed "s|^|${i}:|"
      r=$?
    fi
    test "$r" -ne 0 && res="$r"
  done
  exit $res


  9.  Using bzip2 with Netscape under the X.

  tenthumbs@cybernex.net says:


       I also found a way to get Linux Netscape to use bzip2 for Content-
       Encoding just as it uses gzip. Add this to $HOME/.Xdefaults or
       $HOME/.Xresources

       I use the -s option because I would rather trade some decompressing
       speed for RAM usage. You can leave the option out if you want to.



  Netscape*encodingFilters:      \
          x-compress :  : .Z     : uncompress -c  \n\
          compress   :  : .Z     : uncompress -c  \n\
          x-gzip     :  : .z,.gz : gzip -cdq      \n\
          gzip       :  : .z,.gz : gzip -cdq      \n\
          x-bzip2    :  : .bz2   : bzip2 -ds \n



  10.  Using bzip2 to recompress other compression formats

  The following perl program takes files compressed in other formats
  (.tar.gz, .tgz. .tar.Z, and .Z for this iteration) and repacks them
  for better compression.  The perl source has all kinds of neat
  documentation on what it does and how it does what it does.  This
  latest version takes files as input on the command line.  Without
  command line arguments, it tries to repack every file in the current
  working directory.



  #!/usr/bin/perl -w

  #######################################################
  #                                                     #
  # This program takes compressed and gzipped programs  #
  # in the current directory and turns them into bzip2  #
  # format.  It handles the .tgz extension in a         #
  # reasonable way, producing a .tar.bz2 file.          #
  #                                                     #

  }

      print "Repacking $_ ($counter/$total)...\n";
      if ((system "gzip -cd $_ |bzip2 >$new") == 0) {
          $new_size = (stat $new)[7];
          $factor = int(100*$new_size/$orig_size+.5);
          $saved_bytes += $orig_size-$new_size;
          print "$new is about $factor% of the size of $_. :",($factor<100)?')':'(',"\n";
          unlink $_;

      system ('chmod', '0666', '/tmp/machine_bzip2_total');
  }


  chomp($machine_bzip2_total = `cat $totals_file`);
  open TOTAL, ">$totals_file"
       or die "Can't open system-wide total: $!";
  $machine_bzip2_total += $saved_bytes;
  print TOTAL $machine_bzip2_total;
  close TOTAL;

  print "That's a machine-wide total of ",`cat $totals_file`," bytes saved.\n";
