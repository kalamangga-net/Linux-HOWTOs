  1.  Introduction

  This document describes a simple three step procedure for using
  Loadlin to dual boot between Linux and Windows 95/98/ME. If you prefer
  to use the LILO boot manager, please consult the Linux+Win95 Mini-
  HOWTO.


  This version of this mini-HOWTO has been completely rewritten with
  major differences from the previous version (1.4.6). The following
  highlight the major differences:



  ·  Name change. The Loadlin+Win95/98/ME mini-HOWTO was formerly known
     as "The Loadlin+Win95 mini-HOWTO. The change was made to more
     accurately reflect the topic covered herein.


  ·  The focus has changed from Win95 to Win98, and as a result this
     mini-HOWTO is simpler and easier to follow. Microsoft made some
     changes in the way Windows boots in Win98, which has made most of
     the dual boot methods for Win95 incompatable with Win98. If you
     still wish to see the Win95 specific mini-HOWTO you can view it
     here.

  2.  About Loadlin



  2.1.  What is Loadlin?

  Loadlin is a simple DOS based utility that loads the Linux kernel into
  memory from DOS. Loadlin was written by Hans Lermen
  <http://elserv.ffm.fgan.de/~lermen/>. See the Loadlin-1.6 User's Guide
  <http://elserv.ffm.fgan.de/~lermen/manual.txt> for further details
  about Loadlin's features and how to use Loadlin.


  3.  IMPORTANT: Preliminary Information and Setup



  3.1.  Windows ME Users

  Before your read any further, I should mention that this mini-howto
  has some limitations with Windows ME. Based on feedback from Windows
  ME users, the menuing system described in the next section will only
  work from a Windows boot floppy instead of from the hard drive.
  Thanks to Olivier Guichard for pointing me to the relevant Microsoft
  article
  <http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q274/6/46.ASP>.

  Note that only the config.sys and autoexec.bat files need to be on the
  floppy disk. All other files mentioned may reside on the hard drive.

  If booting from a floppy is not an option for you, then please see the
  ``FAQ'' section for alternatives to LILO and Loadlin.


  Any Windows ME users who can find a better way than using a floppy,
  please let me know your solution so I can include it in this mini-
  howto.


  3.2.  Things that are assumed:


  ·  You have successfully installed Windows 95/98/ME.

  ·  Windows 95/98/ME is installed on Drive C.

  ·  You have successfully installed Linux.

  ·  You know what partition Linux is installed on.

  ·  LILO is NOT installed on your hard drive.


  3.3.  Items you need before you start:


  ·  The Loadlin.exe program file

  ·  Your kernel image file, usually bzImage or vmlinuz. (See the
     ``FAQ'' for info).


  4.  Getting started:



  4.1.  Step One:

  Edit (or create) config.sys on the root of Drive C. The contents
  should be similar to the following:



  ______________________________________________________________________
  [menu]
  menuitem=Linux, Mandrake Linux 7.2
  menuitem=Win98, Windows 98
  menucolor=15,1
  menudefault=Win98, 10

  [linux]

  [win98]
  ______________________________________________________________________



  If your system already has a config.sys file, put those contents under
  the [win98] section. The [linux] section is left blank intentionally.



  4.2.  Step Two:


  Edit (or create) autoexec.bat on the root of Drive C. The contents
  should be similar to the following:



       ______________________________________________________________________
       goto %config%

       :linux
       call c:\linux.bat

       :win98
       ______________________________________________________________________



  As above, if you aready have an autoexec.bat file, put those contents
  under the :win98 section.


  4.3.  Step Three:

  Create a file called: linux.bat. Putting it in the root of Drive C is
  as good as place as any (but it can go anywhere so long as you
  reference the    path or location). The contents should be similar to
  the following:



       ______________________________________________________________________
       @echo off
       c:\loadlin c:\vmlinuz root=/dev/hda3 ro
       ______________________________________________________________________



  The above example assumes that loadlin.exe and vmlinuz are located in
  the root of Drive C (or C:\) and that linux is installed on the
  /dev/hda3 partition. Your configuration may be different.


  The important thing here is to make sure that loadlin and your linux
  kernel file are properly referenced. Finished!


  That should work for you, as that is how I have things set up on my
  system, which dual boots with Win98.


  5.  Frequently Asked Questions:


  5.1.  Where can I find more information on using Loadlin?


  ·  Loadlin can be found on your favorite distibution's installation
     CD. Just do a search for 'loadlin'.


  ·  The Loadlin-1.6 User's Guide is available for download at:


       http://elserv.ffm.fgan.de/~lermen/manual.txt
       <http://elserv.ffm.fgan.de/~lermen/manual.txt>


  or

       ftp://ftp.eskimo.com/u/p/praxis/manual.txt

  ·  Additional information is available at:


       http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO-2.html#ss2.2



  5.2.  I am not sure what partition Linux is installed on. How do I
  find out?


  ·  At a Linux shell prompt, run the df utility. If you see a line with
     /boot, then it will be quite obvious. If you do not see a line with
     /boot, then look on the line with a single "/".


  5.3.  Where do I find the kernel image file and how do I copy it to my
  MS-DOS partition?


  ·  The kernel image file is usually called vmlinuz and should be
     located in the '/boot' directory. Often vmlinuz is a symbolic link
     to the actual kernel. If all else fails type:



       ______________________________________________________________________
               find / -name vmlinuz*
       ______________________________________________________________________

  at a Linux shell prompt. This will search all Linux partitions for the
  vmlinuz file. If you have multiple vmlinuz files, then make sure you
  use the correct one. If you are not sure, then the safest bet would be
  to use the most recent one.

  To copy your linux kernel file to your DOS partition, you need to make
  your DOS partition visible to Linux, then mount the partition if it is
  not already. Generally, this should have been set up when you
  installed Linux. All you need to do next is change to the directory
  the vmlinuz file is in and copy it over to DOS using the cp command.

  However, if Linux was not set up to recognize your DOS partition, then
  copy vmlinuz to a floppy. Take any DOS formatted floppy (with enough
  disk space to hold your kernel image file) and insert it into your
  floppy drive. Type:



       ______________________________________________________________________

               mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
       ______________________________________________________________________



  at a Linux shell prompt. Then change to the directory your kernel
  image file is in and type:



       ______________________________________________________________________

               cp vmlinuz /mnt/floppy
       ______________________________________________________________________



  This will copy vmlinuz to your floppy disk and it will be readable by
  DOS. Shutdown Linux, boot to DOS, then copy vmlinuz to whichever
  directory you choose. If you recompile your kernel, do not forget to
  copy the new kernel image file to your DOS partition. This will
  overwrite your old file, so it might be a good idea to rename the old
  file first just in case the new one does not work properly.


  Alternatively, if you have the mtools utilities you could type:



       ______________________________________________________________________

               mcopy vmlinuz a:
       ______________________________________________________________________



  5.4.  Does it matter if I install Linux or Windows 95/98/ME first?



  ·  Technically no. However, it would be much simpler to install
     Windows first. That way it is easier to setup Linux to recognize
     your DOS partition(s) as you can usually do this during the Linux
     installation.


  5.5.  do I remove LILO?  I currently have LILO installed, but I want
  to use Loadlin instead. How


  ·  You will need to restore the Win95 MBR (Master Boot Record) that
     LILO overwrote when you installed LILO. At a DOS prompt type:



       ______________________________________________________________________

               fdisk /mbr
       ______________________________________________________________________



  5.6.  want to boot to Linux using this method?  What if I already dual
  boot between Windows 95 and Windows 3.x, and I


  ·  Frankly, if you want to do this I would recommend using LILO.
     However, if you really do not want to use LILO, you will have to
     boot to Win 3.x first, then issue the Loadlin command. (Make sure
     Windows 3.x is NOT running, but that you are in DOS 5.0 or 6.x).


  5.7.  Is it possible to initiate Linux from the Windows 95/98/ME desk­
  top?


  ·  Yes. First, create a batch file called "linux.bat", for example.
     Edit the file to contain a Loadlin command such as:



       ______________________________________________________________________

               loadlin f:\vmlinuz root=/dev/hdc2 ro
       ______________________________________________________________________



  Now save the file on your Windows desktop. Next, right click on the
  Linux.bat icon, then left click on Properties. Now click on the
  Program tab, then click on the Advanced button. Click on the box next
  to "MS-DOS mode" and make sure the box next to "Warn before entering
  MS-DOS mode is checked". Click OK, then click on OK again. Now when
  you double click on the Linux icon, a warning box will appear before
  going into MS-DOS mode. If you click on "Yes" then Windows enters MS-
  DOS mode and executes the Linux.bat file.

  NOTE: You must be in MS-DOS mode in order to use Loadlin. Please see
  the manual.txt file mentioned in ``Section 4.1'' of this ``FAQ'' for
  more information.



  5.8.  Where can I get a plain text version of this document?


  ·  You can get a plain text version of this document at:

       ftp://ftp.eskimo.com/u/p/praxis/loadlin.txt



  5.9.  Is Loadlin the only alternative to LILO?


  ·  No. There are other utilities you could use for dual booting:

       GRUB: The GNU GRand Unified Bootloader



       XOSL: Extended Operating System Loader



       Other Bootloaders and Related Links
