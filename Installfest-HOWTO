1. Introduction

   This document provides some guidelines that should help you run a
   successful installfest. For purposes of this document, an installfest
   is a gathering at which experienced Linux users assist less
   experienced users with the installation and configuration of Linux
   distributions, and where Linux users can bring Linux systems to
   receive assistance with system problem remediation.

   Please take from this document whatever you want. It is meant to be a
   guide, not a recipe that must be followed exactly to have a
   successful installfest. Any installfest where most of the people
   leave happy is a successful event.

1.2. Scope

   In order to limit the scope of this document, there are some issues
   that will not be covered:

     * While other activities may occur at the same time and in roughly
       the same location as an installfest, they will not be considered
       part of the installfest for the purposes of this document.
     * This document does not include any discussion of technical issues
       related to the installation of any Linux distribution.
     * This document does not currently contain any discussion of
       installfest server or network configuration, although such a
       discussion may be added to this document in the future. It may be
       more appropriate for such information to be contained in a
       separate HOWTO.
     * This document does not contain any discussion of new user
       education.

          DHCP), mirrors of Linux distributions
     ________________________________________________________________

3. Before, During and After

   This HOWTO has three sections for things you should think about or do
   before, during and after the day of the installfest. It is assumed
   that you will be having installfests periodically and hopefully
   regularly.
     ________________________________________________________________

3.1. Before (preparation)

3.1.1. date, time and duration

   In order to reach the most people, fests should be held on both
   weekends and weekdays. The time of day is not as important as the
   duration of the fest, which should be 6 to 10 hours. Here is why:

     * some people will not be able to arrive when the fest starts
     * it takes time to get systems moved in, connected, disconnected
       and moved out of the working area
     * making sub-systems like sound, printers and other peripherals
       function properly sometimes takes as long as a Linux installation
     * some people want to get some life out of older CPUs but OS
       installation takes longer on slower machines
     ________________________________________________________________

3.1.2. location

   Make sure that the place where your installfest will be held has:

   strong tables
          Each table may have to hold multiple monitors and computers.

   restrooms

   chairs
          People will want to sit down since they will be at the fest
          for several hours.

   Internet access
          Some people will want to know that they can access the
          Internet from their computer. Some people will need to
          download drivers or other software. A lot of helpful
          information is available on the Net. There is a list of Web
          sites at the end of this document.

   an address that is easy to find
          A map and simple directions will help.

   an easy way to get hardware in and out
          How will people bring their hardware from their cars to the
          installation room? Are carts and elevators available?

   sufficient AC power
          Try to make sure that you have enough power for the number of
          computers that you expect people to bring. You do not want
          people to suddenly lose power because one person too many
          turned on his or her computer.

          How much power does a computer need? Laptops need about 0.5
          amps. For a desktop/tower/workstation type of computer the
          amount of power needed depends on the monitor, number of disk
          drives, etc. Basically though, if everything is connected to
          one power strip, then they need at most 3 to 4 amps at the
          moment that the power is turned on and 1.5 to 2 amps while
          they are running.

          You should try to have access to the circuit breakers either
          directly or through readily available maintenance staff.

   If you are lucky you will be able to make arrangements to regularly
   hold installfests at a few locations that meet your needs. If
   possible you should hold your fests at a variety of locations such as
   technical colleges, universities and businesses because Linux is for
   everyone.
     ________________________________________________________________

3.1.3. administration

   Linux distributions (distros)
          Make sure that you will have several copies of the latest
          versions of the major Linux distributions available on CD. To
          learn which distributions to make available, please do a
          little research on the Web sites listed in the appendix of
          this document.

   installfest server
          You may want to consider setting up a server for:

          + DNS
          + DHCP
          + mirrors of distributions

          You should provide multiple methods of accessing the
          distributions on the server:

          + FTP
          + rcp
          + HTTP
          + CD burning
          + NFS

          In order to conserve disk space you can create a virtual
          CD-ROM jukebox. See Randolph J. Tata's "CDServer-HOWTO"
          ([http://talcon.com/cdserver-howto/]
          http://talcon.com/cdserver-howto/) and Jeremy Impson's article
          "Build a Virtual CD-ROM Jukebox" (
          http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5639 ) for more
          information.

          Hopefully someone will create a new Linux distribution to make
          it easy to set up such a server.

   name tags
          Something similar to the classic "hello my name is:" stickers.

   misc. office supplies
          You may want to make some of the following items available:
          scratch paper, ball-point pens, sharpies, scissors, stapler,
          duct tape, packing tape, blank CD-R media.

   advertising
          People will need to know:

          + when and where the installfest will be held
          + what to expect: waiver, soft drinks, pizza
          + that if they wish to install a Linux distribution should
            bring every part of their computer system: monitor,
            keyboard, mouse, speakers, USB devices, power strip. Support
            people will need all the components to make sure everything
            is functioning properly.
          + that they may want to bring blank CD-R media to trade for
            copies of distributions on CD-R (they should determine the
            number of disks needed for each distribution)

          Here are some places to consider advertising:

          + local computer user Web sites
          + local news media
          + local computer retail stores

   minimum system requirements
          Some people will want to install Linux on very old/slow
          systems in an attempt to make them usable. This is OK, but
          there are limitations. Please look at the distributions area
          of [http://www.linux.org] www.linux.org for minimalist
          distributions. You may want to include minimum system
          requirements in your installfest advertisement so that people
          do not show up with an old machine, hoping to turn it into a
          power-house but leave disappointed.

   networking equipment
          someone will need to bring network switches and cables

   signage
          You should have a few signs posted to help people find their
          way around the location and provide other information. Some
          examples are:

          + main entrance: So people know that they have found the right
            location.
          + reception desk: People will need to find the reception desk
            from the main entrance.
          + installation room: People will need to know how to get to
            the installation from the reception desk.
          + rest rooms
          + networking information

   food and beverages
          Due to the duration of an installfest you should consider the
          availability of food and drink.

          Pizza usually works out well. Tell people that you will be
          collecting a specific amount of money at the door for pizza.
          If they do not want to share some pizza, then they do not need
          to pay. In order to know who has paid, use an ink stamp to
          mark their hand. Do not forget paper plates and napkins.

          If there are no vending machines at the location you may want
          to provide soft drinks, including water and possibly coffee
          during the fest. If you do provide drinks, you should consider
          selling them at cost.
     ________________________________________________________________

3.2. During (on the day of the installfest)

    1. before the starting time
       The people who run the fest need to be at the location at least
       one hour before the fest is to begin. They will need time to set
       up the network, installfest server, power system, signage, etc.
    2. at the door/reception
       Depending on how you have decided to operate your fest, the
       receptionist will:
          + ask users to sign a waiver
          + ask users to fill out a data sheet
          + ask all attendees to contribute money for food and/or drinks
          + give all attendees name tags
    3. during
       Since you are using this HOWTO, everything will work out fine.
       People should understand that it is OK to ask around for help.
    4. after the fest is finished
       Make sure that all areas are cleaned up because you may want to
       use the location again and you do not want to give the location
       owner a bad impression. Look for: items people have forgotten,
       items that people brought as "give aways", drink cans and cups.
     ________________________________________________________________

3.3. After (lessons learned)

   We would like to continually improve this document and everyone's
   installfest experience, so please share with us:

     * what went wrong?
     * what went well?
     * new ideas?
     * How this document helped or hindered you.

A.2. Legal Protection

   You may want to consider having users sign some kind of agreement
   before any work is performed on their systems. Such a document will
   make it clear to users exactly what they can and cannot expect from
   the installfest.

   If you do decide to use one of these documents, please have it
   reviewed by a lawyer in your area.

   If you do have an agreement approved by a lawyer, please contribute
   to the Linux community by sending a copy to the lead author of this
   HOWTO so that it may be included in future versions.
     ________________________________________________________________

A.2.1. Release

   The following is a significantly modified version of a form posted on
   David Pitts's Web site.

   INSTALLFEST RELEASE FORM

   By signing this release agreement between you and the group holding
   the installfest (members of the __________________________ Linux
   User's Group, hereinafter referred to as Installers), you give up
   certain legal rights. Therefore, you should read the agreement
   carefully. If you have any questions about the legal effect of this
   agreement, you should consult an attorney and not any of the
   Installers. Please be aware that you may not participate in the
   installfest event unless you have signed this agreement. By signing
   this release agreement, you acknowledge the following:

    1. That your signing this agreement is partial consideration for the
       services provided by Installers.
    2. That Installers do not promise that the work done on your
       computer equipment will be successful. An Installer will help you
       attempt to install, configure, or otherwise get the Linux
       operating system to work on your computer equipment. However,
       because of possible defects in computer software or computer
       hardware, including improperly configured computer hardware, not
       every attempt is successful.
    3. That the attempt to install, configure, or otherwise get the
       Linux operating system to work on your computer equipment has
       inherent dangers that no amount of care, caution, instruction, or
       expertise can eliminate.
    4. That any attempt to install, configure, or otherwise get the
       Linux operating system to work on your computer equipment,
       especially including any attempt to partition or re-partition
       your computer's hard drive, may result in the loss of some or all
       of the data stored on that hard drive. That you are hereby
       advised that you should back up all important data before the
       attempt to install, configure or otherwise get the Linux
       operating system to work on your computer equipment.
    5. That an installfest is an inherently chaotic event at which many
       computer components, peripherals and systems are present;
       therefore, you are responsible for the security of your property.
    6. That you are expressly assuming the risks of the dangers set
       forth above.
    7. That by signing this release agreement, you hereby forever
       release the Installers from any legal liability they might have
       arising from the attempt to install, configure, or otherwise get
       the Linux operating system to run on your computer equipment.
       That this release includes, but is not limited to, any losses
       caused by the negligence of any Installer who attempts to
       install, configure or otherwise get the Linux operating system to
       work on your computer.

   By signing below, you agree that you understand the terms above:

0. PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   functional and useful document ‚free‚ in the sense of freedom: to

   it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
   whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
   principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

   of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
   publishers or authors of the Document to the Document‚s overall
   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
   directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in
   part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
   any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
   connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
   commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
   them.

   The ‚Invariant Sections‚ are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
   are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
   that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
   section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
   allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
   Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
   Sections then there are none.

   The ‚Cover Texts‚ are certain short passages of text that are listed,
   as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
   that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text
   may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
   words.

   A ‚Transparent‚ copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the
   general public, that is suitable for revising the document
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
   of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
   available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
   formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
   suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
   Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been
   arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers
   is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for
   any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not ‚Transparent‚ is
   called ‚Opaque‚.

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
   ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
   or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
   HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
   transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
   include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
   proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
   processing tools are not generally available, and the
   machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
   processors for output purposes only.

   The ‚Title Page‚ means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
   plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
   material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works
   in formats which do not have any title page as such, ‚Title Page‚
   means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work‚s
   title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

   The ‚publisher‚ means any person or entity that distributes copies of
   the Document to the public.

   A section ‚Entitled XYZ‚ means a named subunit of the Document whose
   title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
   following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ
   stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
   ‚Acknowledgements‚, ‚Dedications‚, ‚Endorsements‚, or ‚History‚.) To
   ‚Preserve the Title‚ of such a section when you modify the Document
   means that it remains a section ‚Entitled XYZ‚ according to this
   definition.

   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
   which states that this License applies to the Document. These
   Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
   this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
   implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
   no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
   to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
   other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
   technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
   copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
   compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
   number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
   you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
   printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
   Document‚s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
   copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
   Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
   the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
   you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
   the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
   visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
   Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
   the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be
   treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
   more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
   copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque
   copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using
   public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
   a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
   If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
   when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
   that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
   location until at least one year after the last time you distribute
   an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
   edition to the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
   the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
   to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
   Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
   the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
   the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
   Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
   and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
   of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
       distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
       versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
       History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a
       previous version if the original publisher of that version gives
       permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
       entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
       Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
       authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
       fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
       Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
       notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
       under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the
       Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
       Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document‚s license
       notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section Entitled ‚History‚, Preserve its Title, and
       add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
       and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
       If there is no section Entitled ‚History‚ in the Document, create
       one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
       Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing
       the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on. These may be placed in the ‚History‚ section.
       You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
       least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. For any section Entitled ‚Acknowledgements‚ or ‚Dedications‚,
       Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
       all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
       acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
       their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent
       are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section Entitled ‚Endorsements‚. Such a section may
       not be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ‚Endorsements‚
       or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
    O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
   appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
   copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or
   all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to
   the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version‚s license
   notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section Entitled ‚Endorsements‚, provided it contains
   nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties
   ‚ for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been
   approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and
   a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
   list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
   Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
   through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
   includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
   by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
   you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
   permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
   list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
   license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
   copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
   different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
   adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
   author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique
   number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
   Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ‚History‚
   in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
   ‚History‚; likewise combine any sections Entitled ‚Acknowledgements‚,
   and any sections Entitled ‚Dedications‚. You must delete all sections
   Entitled ‚Endorsements‚.

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
   documents released under this License, and replace the individual
   copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
   that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
   rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
   in all other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
   distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
   copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
   License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
   document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
   and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, is called an ‚aggregate‚ if the copyright
   resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
   of the compilation‚s users beyond what the individual works permit.
   When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
   apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
   derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
   copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
   the entire aggregate, the Document‚s Cover Texts may be placed on
   covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
   electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
   form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the
   whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
   distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
   Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
   permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
   translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
   original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
   translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
   Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
   include the original English version of this License and the original
   versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement
   between the translation and the original version of this License or a
   notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

   If a section in the Document is Entitled ‚Acknowledgements‚,
   ‚Dedications‚, or ‚History‚, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
   its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
   title.

9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
   except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
   will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
   license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
   provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
   finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
   copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
   reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
   reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
   violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
   received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
   copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
   your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
   licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
   this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
   reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material
   does not give you any rights to use it.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
   GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/] Copyleft.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
   If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
   License ‚or any later version‚ applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version
   or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by
   the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a
   version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
   published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
   Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
   this License can be used, that proxy‚s public statement of acceptance
   of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
   the Document.

11. RELICENSING

   ‚Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site‚ (or ‚MMC Site‚) means any
   World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
   provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A
   public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A
   ‚Massive Multiauthor Collaboration‚ (or ‚MMC‚) contained in the site
   means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

   ‚CC-BY-SA‚ means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
   license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
   corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
   California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
   published by that same organization.

   ‚Incorporate‚ means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
   in part, as part of another Document.
