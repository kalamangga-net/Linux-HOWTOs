  v0.0.7 August 2004

  The SPARC family of microprocessors is a very good implementation of
  the RISC design and SPARC based computing devices cover a very wide
  spectrum of applications, from mainframe class computers to radhard
  microprocessors used by the aerospace industry in its space segment.
  SPARC based computers are usually very well engineered products, thus
  Linux on SPARC is a winning combination both in performance and ease
  of use. Actually this combination is not as widspread as the
  Linux/x86; this HOWTO should help you step by step to make an informed
  decision: try it you will not regret it.

  1.  Preface.

  This document is a step by step guide meant to provide information in
  order to help you running Linux on SPARC based computers, As these
  computers are quite different from PCs an  hardware section will
  provide you with the needed information in order to understand how
  they work and what can be expected from the various CPUs and models.

  I am not a SPARC specialist, nor a Solaris or Linux guru, I am just
  someone who is realy found of well engineered products, and  wish to
  help you in choosing your hardware and finding information. Thus I
  have tried to write down this document in order to ease your path.


  I hope this HOWTO will help you and you will have a lot of fun with
  your SPARC Computer.


  1.1.  Translations.

  Kim Hyun-Gyu <babyworm@atlas.korea.ac.kr> provide a Korean
  translation. You can read it online at
  http://kldp.org/HOWTO/html/SPARC-HOWTO/


  2.  SPARC, which one ?

  This document deals only with SPARC based computers, in order to
  check, just type uname -m command and you should read something like
  sparc4x where x is blank,c,d,m,u if the system runs Solaris, or sparc
  for 32 bits SPARC architectures and sparc64 for 64 bits SPARC
  architectures if it runs Linux.  2.x.y



  SPARC stands for Scalable Processor ARChitecture, it derives from
  research done between 1984-1988 on the  RISC architecture at UC
  Berkeley.  It exists 3 versions of this archiecture, SPARC-V7, SPARC-
  V8 (32 bits) and SPARC-V9 (64 bits).  As you  are likely to encounter
  a lot of implementations of the SPARC architecture, in the next
  section,  the main features of theses processors are summarized.


  2.1.  Sun SPARC

  This is quite obsolete, it is an implementation of the SPARC-V7 ; its
  main feature are an Integer unit (IU), an external Floating Point Unit
  (FPU), an unified data + instruction 64KB direct associative cache,
  and an Memory Managment Unit (MMU).  There is a 4 stage pipeline for
  the integer instructions (fetch F, decode D, exec E, update WB) FPU
  and IU are synchronized.


  2.2.  Super SPARC

  This is Texas Instrument and Sun's brainchild, it is usualy found at
  around 50Mhz clok rates featuring up to 1MB of L2 cache, it is
  available both as single and dual processor modules (SparcStation 10
  and SparcStation 20). The higher clock frequency I have encountered so
  far is 60Mhz.

  On a technical point of view this is a SPARC-V8 implementation, it is
  a superscalar processor, having 2 caches, one for instruction the
  other one for data.

  ·  The 20kB instruction cache is a 5 way associative.

  ·  The 16KB data cache is 4 way associative.


  2.3.  Micro SPARC

  This is once again Texas Instrument and Sun's brainchild, it can be
  found in the SparcStation Classic, SparcStation LX, at frequency up to
  50Mhz. Its derivative, the Micro SPARC II can be found in the
  SparcStation 4 and SparcStation 5 at frequencies up to 110Mhz.

  On a technical point of view, its main features are a high level of
  integration, having 2 caches, one for instructions, the other one for
  data.


  ·  A 4KB instruction direct associative cache.

  ·  A 2KB data direct associative cache.



  It is not possible to add an L2 cache.  If you wish to learn more
  about the MicroSPARC processor you can browse Sun's Ultra SPARC
  ressources.


  2.4.  Hyper SPARC

  This processor was introduced by ROSS in 1993, it is usualy found in
  the SparcStation 10, and SparcStation 20, at frequencies up to 150Mhz
  (I have heard of 200Mhz dual processor modules, but Have not witnessed
  one yet). It can be found on single or dual processor modules.


  On a technical point of view it is an implementation of the SPARC-V8,
  it is superscalar. It can be found with L2 cache up to 512KB


  2.5.  ERC32

  This is a radhard SPARC V7 microprocessor designed to be used on the
  space segment.

  It comes as a single unit or as a three chip package. Main
  manufacturer is  ATMEL in Nantes, France. At least, one software
  vendor claims to have GNU/Linux running on this CPU, this is for the

  http://dse.cyberclwn.com/sparc-rtems-erc32.htm. This project has not
  been updated since March 2001. As I have not had the opportunity to
  check this claim. I am more than doubtful.


  2.6.  LEON

  This is also a radhard implementation of the SPARC V8 designed to be
  used on the space segment. It is the ESA's brainchild and the lead
  designer is jiri gaisler.  More information can be found on LEON's
  website: http://www.gaisler.com/leonmain.html

  The 2.4 and 2.5 kernel series are not yet supported, however the 2.0
  kernel series is supported by the uClinux MMU less GNU/Linux
  distribution.  This distribution has been built at ESA/ESTEC December
  26 2003 on a SuSE 8.0 GNU/Linux distribution with gcc version 2.95.3
  20010315 and a 2.4.18 kernel.  Hereafter is the boot sequence and a
  sample session inside the tsim-leon simulator.

  2.7.  Ultra SPARC

  The Ultra SPARC processor is an extension of the SPARC-V9
  architecture, it is a 64 bits processor, it features some video
  processing instructions. It is found in all the computer whose name
  start with Ultra.

  The Ultra SPARC II is an improvement of the Ultra SPARC, the Ultra
  SPARCIII is actually the second generation of Ultra SPARC processors,
  it was first introduced in the SunBlade 1000 Workstation.  If wish to
  learn more about the UltraSPARC processors you can browse Sun's Ultra
  SPARC ressources.


  2.8.  SPARC64 V


  This processor is based on the SPARC V9 and is made by Fujitsu It is a
  64bits CPU with some very interesting error handling features such as
  ECC memory for the L1 cache, hardware instruction retry, error
  classification.

  There is a 64 bit virtual address space and 43 bit physical address
  space.  It is used in the PRIMEPOWER high end servers to mainframe
  class of Fujitsu's offering.

  The cache is organized as :

  ·  A 128kB 2 way associative L1 instruction cache

  ·  A 128kB 2 way associative L1 data cache

  ·  A 2MB unified 4 way associative L2 cache

  More information can be found on the
  http://www.fujitsu.com/downloads/PRMPWR/JPS1-R1.0-SPARC64V-pub.pdf
  whitepaper.

  You may read the CPU-Design-HOWTO, this HOWTO has a lot of interesting
  links when it comes to studying the CPUs.

  To summarize, the 32 bits workstations are the:

  ·  The sun4 workstation is the sun4/330 model.

  ·  The sun4c workstations are the SparcStation 1,2, IPC and IPX
     models.

  ·  The sun4m workstations are the SparcStation 5, 10 and 20.

     Only the SparcStation 10 and SparcStation 20 are SMP capable: up to
     2 CPU modules.

  For more information on the SparcStation 5, 10, 20 you can read Sun's
  documentation online or download it available.

  The following model have an 64 bits UltraSPARC architecture (sun4u).
  SunUltra 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, 80 and SunBlade 1000, 1500, 2000.  The
  SunUltra 2, 60, 80 and SunBlade 1000 are SMP capable, with the Ultra
  80 and SunBlade 1000 and 2000 accepting up to 4 CPU modules, the
  SunUltra 2 and 60 accepting only 2 CPU modules.

  The SunBlade 2000 is the latest one featuring Sun's latest marvel the
  Ultra III CPU, at a premium price of course.  You can have a summary
  of the UltraWorkstation still in production at Sun's website.

  A lot of information has been compiled in the Sun hardware reference
  that is found on many sites, or on SunHelp 's  website.


  2.9.  Deciphering the CPUs

  At first, a reference like SM61 or RT-200-D-125/512 seems to be, to
  say the least, quite cryptic.  Actually, understanding theses
  references is really easy.


  2.9.1.  Ross Technology.

  Theses CPUs's naming scheme is RT-a00-b-freq/cache where

  ·  a is a digit:

  ·  1 SparcStation 10.

  ·  2 SparcStation 20.

  ·  6 SPARC MP600 ( not exactly a workstation ).

  ·  b is a letter:

  ·  D Dual CPU.

  ·  Q Quad CPU.

  ·  S Single CPU.

  ·  freq The frequency expressed in Megahertz.

  ·  cache The amount of cache memory expressed in Kilobytes.

  When these modules are in a workstation the naming convention is HSxy,
  for example ywing is a SparcStation 20 HS22, thus it is easier to have
  a look inside the workstation.

  2.9.2.  SM modules.

  Warning: the SM100 is a RT-600-D-40



  2.9.3.  Cypress.

  Cypress manufactured SPARC compliants processors; AFAIK their naming
  scheme is CYnnn.

  As you can see, this is easy to understand.


  2.10.  The javastation.

  This is a family of Network computers that used to be manufactured by
  Sun, there is a very good JavaStation-HOWTO about it.


  3.  Buying a SPARC computer.


  You have decided to buy a SPARC based computer, now you can tell what
  CPU each model sports, but can you tell how that particuliar model
  looks like? How its is inside?

  Do not worry, this section will help you on that topic as well as
  providing you with some hints on how to inspect and test the hardware.


  3.1.  Gaigning a visual familiarity with SPARC hardware


  PC hardware is everywhere and usualy one is quite familiar with it,
  this is not exactly the case with SPARC based hardware, even more when
  it comes to the innards of a computer. The good news is that it exists
  some sites on the web, where you can find pictures of Sun hardware,
  with some very detailed shots, thus you should be able to instantly
  identify the model and its condition prior to buy it.  The two main
  site where I usualy go are:

  ·  sun In Sun's database, you can find technical data as well as
     picture of some of Sun's product, the pictures are crisp, and the
     hardware is always at its best, this is technicaly interesting, in
     order to compare brand new hardware and the used one that is usualy
     featured on the two sites below.

  ·  HAL This site features very detailed pictures of a lot of hardware,
     from CPU modules to Servers, even mice.

  ·  obsolyte This site has different pictures, it is very useful too.


  3.2.  Sun made hardware or clones ?

  On the one hand, it is very easy to find information on Sun hardware,
  while it can be difficult to find it for clone systems on the other
  hand it should be more fun to work with exotic hardware.

  Clone systems have been or are still manufactured, at least by:

  ·  Fujitsu.

  ·  Toshiba

  ·  Ross

  ·  Tadpole/RDI manufactures SPARC based laptops.

  ·  Tatung is still in the market and sells SBus, PCI cards, and of
     course systems up to the UltraSPARC III based 2U and 4U servers.
     For more information about tatung's COMPServer and COMPStations,
     please read the Tatung's Workstations and Servers sections of this
     document.

  ·  Toshiba, used to manufacture SPARC based laptops: The AS1000.

  3.3.  Where to buy.

  Of course if you buy first hand hardware everything should be fine,
  but if you decide to go for second hand hardware, you will have to
  decide how you want to buy it, and you should be able to test it by
  yourself.

  Second hand hardware can be brought from Sun as refurbished hardware,
  at auction websites, or in specialised stores, or directly from
  companys that upgrade their hardware.


  3.4.  Checklist

  When it comes to second hand hardware one has to be as cautious as
  possible about the source, and the condition  of that hardware.

  For the source of the hardware, if you can track it, it is a very good
  point. If you can't track it, it is up to you to decide if you trust
  the seller or not ( If the seller cannot give you the reference of the
  hardwre and if, obviously he/she is clueless about Sun hardware, you
  should switch to condition red ).

  Another interesting point is to see if check is accepted as a
  payement.

  If you can check the hardware before buying it then first have a
  general look at it, search for cracks, for stains; check the
  connector's pin. If this first inspection is OK, then ask to see the
  inside, look for spills, watch carefuly the connectors, then if it is
  OK ask to see it running, watch carefully boot messages, issue the
  dmesg|more or if it runs Solaris you can issue the more
  /var/adm/messages command, and also very important listen to your
  computer, do you hear unusual noises? Does it smell OK?. Then enter
  the OpenBoot by the stop+a command and run some tests ( see the
  OpenBoot section ).  When you have decided to purchase it, it is very
  important that you always make sure that the computer you are
  purchasing is the one you have tested: always keep an eye on it, do
  not let someone go to the backoffice with it for example, do not
  accept to leave without your computer.

  Then, when you are at home, recheck it as if it was the first time you
  see it.  If it comes with CDROM drive, try to mount/umount a few CDs
  and read them in order to check that device. If there is a floppy disk
  read/write/format a few floppys, this should be a good test.



  Of course, it exists tools to automaticaly test the hardware, but
  usualy you do not have them when you need them, thus the script below
  relies only on ressources provided by a Linux base system.


  You should run the following script for three days, basicaly it is
  going to use the CDROM, floppy and hard drive, and to reboot the
  computer every 3 hours. This should stress it,



  ______________________________________________________________________
  #
  # Enter this in the crontab(5)
  # run the torture.sh script every 3 hours if possible
  #

   mount -t ext2 $FLOPPY /floppy
   cd /bin/
   cp dd ps echo sh /floppy
   find /floppy -exec cat {} \; >>/dev/null 2>&1
   umount /floppy
   CPT=$(($CPT+1))
  done


  #

  find $PATH -exec test -x {} \; -exec rm -f {} \; >/dev/null 2>&1

  #
  # time to reboot
  #
  reboot
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Of course you should run this script manualy once in order to know how
  much time it requires to complete, this is just an idea on how to
  automate things.


  4.  SPARC based laptops


  There exists SPARC based, laptops.

  They are not very widespread but, they are actually very good SPARC
  workstations.

  ·  SparcBook 1:

  ·  SparcBook 2:

  ·  Tadpole SparcBook 3GX: This is a 100Mhz MicroSPARC II (TI) with a
     Weitek P9100 frame buffer and a screen resolution of 800x600.
     GNU/Linux runs on it The PCMCIA, internal modem and power
     management are not supported at the time of this writing.

     For more information about the SPARCBooks there exists a SPARCBook
     FAQ, you can read it at http://hvdkooij.xs4all.nl/docs/SparcBook-
     FAQ.html

  There exists a Linux Mobile Guide that provides you with the needed
  informations about GNU/Linux on laptops.  You can read it there:
  http://www.tuxmobil.org/Mobile-Guide.db/Mobile-Guide.html

  Today there are some manufacturers of SPARC based laptops.  You can
  access their websites at

  ·  Tadpole: http://www.tadpolecomputer.com/html/

  ·  Nextcomputing: http://www.nextcomputing.com At least one of their
     laptops, the NextBlade 150 is advertised as being capable to run
     both Solaris and the RedHat GNU/Linux.


  5.  The wonderful SparcStation Voyager



  Nearly ten years ago in 1994, Sun microsystems introduced the
  SPARCStation Voyager (ss240).  This computer was a Sun4m architecture,
  powered by a microSPARC II processor.  It is a very compact computer,
  behing a hybrid between a desktop and a Laptop.  It has the footprint
  of a very compact workstation with a builtin color LCD display, PCMCIA
  and InfraRed ports with a 2"5 SCSI harddrive.  I have seen one at the
  CCC in Berlin, runing Debian GNU/Linux but the InfraRed and PCMCIA
  ports are not supported.  Its datasheet is actually very impressive:


  ·  60 Mhz microSPARC

  program which is a collaborative research program between Fujitsu
  Laboratories and the Australian National University.  This computer
  was used in the phase 1 of this project.  They have managed to run
  Linux on a 16 node computer with 16 MB ram per CPU module. More
  information about this project can be found on this page:
  http://cap.anu.edu.au/cap/projects/linux/

  11.  Linux on SPARC: 2 kernels.

  Actually Linux on SPARC architecture comes in two flavors:

  ·  A 32 bits kernel for the Sun SPARC, Super SPARC, Micro SPARC and
     Hyper SPARC Processors.

  ·  A 64 bits kernel for UltraSPARC based computers.

     In both case most applications run in 32 bit ( 32 bit userland ).
     There is a comprehensive FAQ  on UltraLinux's website.


  12.  Choosing a distribution.


  You are very lucky, it seems that you can pick the one you like.  In
  order to help you with this task here are some links, that should help
  you to make an informed decision.

  There exists a port for the SPARC architecture, more information is
  available at http://www.slackware.com/ports/sparc/


  12.7.  SLXT


  Actually, the SPARC-Linux Xterminal Package is not a distribution, it
  is a way to use a diskless SPARCStation as an X terminal. This is a a
  very convenient package.  More information can be found at
  http://www.pucebaboon.com/SLXT/


  12.8.  Linux Terminal Server Project


  The Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) is a convenient way to turn a
  SPARC or an Ultra SPARC workstation into a diskless workstation.  The
  project's homepage is http://www.ltsp.org/

  Step by step instruction to setup a client on an Ultra SPARC can be
  found at the following website: http://math.univ-lille1.fr/ltsp-sparc/
  12.9.  SplackLinux


  It is meant to be Slackware Compatible for SPARC.  Its homepage is
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/splack



  12.10.  SuSE Linux.


  The SuSE Linux 7.3 distribution is quite complete, you have 5 ISOs to
  download. You can grab it at the following URL:
  ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/sparc

  In the subdirectories you will also find bonus software such as KDE
  libraries and programms.

  There is a mirror site located in Germany:
  ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/suse/ And, there are some extra files on
  the SuSE's server.  You can join the mailing list by sending a blank
  mail to < suse-sparc-subscribe@suse.com > More information can be
  found at: http://www.suse.com


  12.11.  Vine Linux


  This is a Japanese distribution and there exist a SPARC port.  It is
  an rpm based distribution.  From the documentation, it supports both
  SPARC 32 and SPARC 64.  The documentation (in Japanese ;-) ) can be
  read online at http://www.vinelinux.org/sparc/2.1.5/install-vine-
  sparc-2.1.5.html


  13.  Installing Linux


  To install Linux on a SPARC based computer, should be strightforward
  if you follow the informations provided by your distribution.

  To boot from a floppy drive you have to have an install image on a
  floppy disk and to issue the boot floppy from the OpenBoot.

  If your computer does not have a CDROM or a floppy drive, you can
  always try to perform a network installation using NFS as explained by
  this French document: http://www.linux-
  france.org/article/materiel/sparc-install/Sparc-netinstall.html .
  Basicaly, you have to set up an NFS server and to boot your computer
  using the boot net vmlinux nfsroot=192.168.52.12:/tmp in order to
  access the image that is exported by the 192.168.52.12 computer on the
  /tmp directory.  Another source of information, this one is written in
  English, is this FAQ from the UltraLinux website (
  http://www.ultralinux.org/faq.html#q_5_9 )


  14.  Working with the Openboot.

  In this section, you will be given an overview of what is the
  OpenBoot, and you will be given the main commands you need to know in
  order to test your hardware and to install Linux.

  14.1.  What is the OpenBoot?



  If you are used to PC hardware, you are used to interact with its
  BIOS. SPARC computers have an Openboot, it may seem to be like your
  BIOS, but it is actually far more powerfull.  The Openboot performs
  the following tasks:

  ·  Testing and initializing the hardware.

  ·  Starting the operating System.

  ·  Giving you acces to a set of tools to program and to debug it.

     The programming language is FCode, if you can program the Forth
     langage, you can program it.

  In this section, we will juste use a small set of the OpenBoot's
  capabilities, in order to test hardware and to boot the system.  First
  you have to enter in the OpenBoot, just hit the stop and a keys
  simultaneously. Then you should see a ok prompt, if instead you see
  the > prompt then type n. Now you can proceed to the next section.


  14.2.  Diagnostics commands.

  The OpenBoot, gives you a lot of commands to test and to gather
  information about your hardware.

  ·  .version Displays version and date of the startup PROM.

  ·  banner You will see the banner, that is displayed at power-on. It
     is useful to gather some data about CPUs.

  ·  pcia-probe-list Test PCI on computers that have a PCI bus.

  ·  module-info This will display the Buses clockspeed, and processors
     frequency and amount of cache.

  ·  probe-scsi This will test all devices connected to the on board
     SCSI controler.

  ·  probe-scsi-all This will test all devices connected to all the SCSI
     controlers.

  ·  show-devs This displays all installed and probed devices.

  ·  show-sbus Use this, if you just want to display a list of installed
     and probed SBus devices.

  ·  test-all This will test all devices in the system that have a self
     test program.

  ·  test floppy If a floppy drive is installed, it will test it
     reminding you to have a formated floppy disk inside.

  ·  test-memory If the system diag-switch? is set to true, this will
     test the memory.

  ·  test net This will test the network interfaces

  ·  watch-aui This will test the AUI ethernet link.  You will see '.'
     for good packets and 'X" for bad ones. Strike any key to abort.

  ·  watch-clock This will test the real time clock chip, it will tick
     once a second. To stop this test strike any key.

  ·  watch-net This will check the network connection ( both AUI and TP
     ). You will see '.' for good packets and 'X" for bad ones. Strike
     any key to abort.

  ·  watch-net-all This will test all Ethernet interfaces.  You will see
     '.' for good packets and 'X" for bad ones. Strike any key to abort.
     When you abort one, it will test the next one.

  ·  watch-tpe This will check the TPE ethernet interface.  You will see
     '.' for good packets and 'X" for bad ones. Strike any key to abort.



  14.3.  Boot commands.

  The OpenBoot allows you to boot from various devices, the command you
  are the more likely to enter are below.

  ·  boot Boot kernel from default device.

  ·  boot cdrom Boot kernel from CDROM drive.

  ·  boot net-tpe Boot kernel from network urnel from CDROM drive, this
     is the command you are the more likely to type when installing
     Linux.

  ·  boot net Boot kernel from network using auto-selected interface.

  ·  boot net-aui Boot kernel from network using AUI interface.

  ·  boot net-tpe Boot kernel from network using TPE interface.

  ·  boot tape Boot default file from tape.



  14.4.  Misc commands.



  ·  eject-floppy Ejects the floppy.

  ·  power-off Poweroff the computer.

     You can  poweroff your computer, when you are working with the
     OpenBoot : just type power-off

  For more informations on the OpenBoot you can read this FAQ at
  http://www.itworld.com/AppDev/616/UIR951001openboot/

  15.  Hard drive buses.

  Depending on their architecture, the computers are likely to feature
  one of the following hard drive buses.


  15.1.  SCSI-SCA.

  An SCSI connector is located at the rear of the Computer; the SCA
  chanel is found on the internal bus of the SPARC Worstation. It can be
  basicaly seen as an SCSI bus that provides power supply and assigns
  SCSI ID to the peripherals.


  15.2.  EIDE.

  This is found for example in an Ultra 5 or Ultra 10 computers This bus
  is the one you can find in your intel box.
  15.3.  FC-AL

  This is the FiberChannel bus.  It is used by the SunBlade 1000
  workstation.


  16.  CDROM: specific settings.

  The easiest way to install linux on SPARC computer is to use a CDROM.
  If your computer does not have a CDROM you can plug an external SCSI
  CDROM drive, but there are two things to do or you are doomed to fail:

  ·  When you issue the boot cdrom command, the CDROM is mapped to ID
     number 6.

  ·  Your CDROM player's block size should be setted up on 512.

     As a rule of thumb, nearly all SCSI CDROM drives can be assigned to
     ID number 6 but you should check if the block size setting can be
     changed.



  17.  SILO.

  The Sparc Improved Boot LOader ( SILO ), is the boot loader that is
  used in the SPARC architecture. It allows you to boot Linux, Solaris
  or SunOS. It can load a Linux kernel from ext2, iso9660, UFS or ROMFS.
  From the SILO's README:

  This is the first attempt at a complete boot loader for Linux on the
  Sparc.  Because of the lack of space on the bootblock, we have to do
  it in two steps, the first step is a very simple loader based on Peter
  Zaitcev's silo (we will call this the first stage loader) which should
  fit in 512B and its sole purpose is to load a more complete bootstrap
  loader, herein refered to as the second stage boot loader. The cool
  thing about the second stage loader we implemented is that it makes
  use of the ext2 library (provided with the ext2fs tools) and some ufs
  code, and thus allows the loader to access any file on a ext2 fs and
  ufs, uses silo.conf, handles gunzipping and a lot of other things.
  This is different from Linux/i386 lilo which needs a map for each
  kernel. In silo we just keep one map file for the second stage loader,
  we don't expect you to be changing the second stage loader on your
  daily routine (you can do so, you will just need to use a tool to
  reinstall the maps).

  Actually, IMHO it is easier to use than LILO.


  18.  Compiling a kernel

  If you have already compiled a kernel on x86 architecture there is
  just a little difference when you wish to compile a kernel on SPARC
  architecture.

  you do not type

  ______________________________________________________________________
  #make zImage
  #make modules
  #make modules_install
  ______________________________________________________________________


  but

  ______________________________________________________________________
  #make vmlinux
  #make modules
  #make modules_install
  ______________________________________________________________________


  More information can be found on http://www.ultralinux.org/faq.html
  Then, from the Ultralinux's FAQ the following steps are :

  ·  1.Copy linux/System.map to your bootfile directory (eg. /boot), and
     rename this file to

     ___________________________________________________________________
     System.map-<kernel-version>
     ___________________________________________________________________



  ·  2.Copy linux/vmlinux to your bootfile directory, and rename this
     file to

     ___________________________________________________________________
     vmlinux-<kernel-version>
     ___________________________________________________________________



  ·  3.Edit /etc/silo.conf, and add your new kernel to this file.

  ·  4.Reboot your machine.

  If you have trouble compiling your kernel, maybe it needs to be
  pached. There are many patches floating around on the net. There
  exists a website that put some of them online on a regular basis both
  for the stable and unstable branches, up to the 2.6.x kernel series.
  Those patches apply to the hardware used by the site's owner and this
  should be considered as a very good starting point to be adapted to
  your hardware.  More information can be found at
  http://osinvestor.com/sparc/ You can also email the site's owner, Rob
  Radez : <rob@osinvestor.com> If you are unfamiliar with paches he also
  made them available as debian packages.



  19.  Keyboard and mouse.

  Most of the sun4m workstation have a special connector for the
  keyboard. In this case the mouse is connected indifferently to left or
  the right side of the keyboard. Some computers have a PS2 connector,
  it is very easy to spot the difference.  The keyboards you are the
  more likely to encounter are the type4 and type5.


  At the time of this writting, I didn't manage to have mouse support on
  the Sun Blade 100. Things should become easier in the near future.


  20.  X Window.


  XFree, usually, runs fine on theses systems.  The table below helps
  you choose the XFree86 4.2.0 server that matches your graphic adapter:


  ______________________________________________________________________

  Graphic Adapter         Xserver

  Sun Creator 3D          sunffb
  Sun Elite 3D            sunffb
  Sun GX                  suncg6
  Sun Leo (ZX)            sunleo
  Sun TCX                 suntcx
  Sun Turbo GX            suncg6
  Sun bw2                 sunbw2
  Sun cg14                suncg14
  Sun cg3                 suncg3
  ______________________________________________________________________



  There is a catch with the  13W3 video connector that equips some of
  the framebuffers you may encounter.  One may try to plug it on a VGA
  monitor using an 13W3 to VGA adaptor that is sold on the market. The
  problem is that SGI and Sun Microsystems do not have the same
  definition of this standard and depending of the adapter you buy, this
  may work or not (you know Murphy ...). As a rule, idealy you should
  try it before you buy.


  21.  SMP.


  Ouaich, SMP is supported, and I am sure that ROSS's dual CPU modules
  are supported as you can see by yourself:


  ______________________________________________________________________

  piou@ywing:~ > cat /proc/cpuinfo

  ______________________________________________________________________



  The SparcStation 10 and SparcStations 20 are SMP capable computers and
  according to the FAQABOSS the following combinations are known to work
  :

  ·  2xSM40 ( model 402 )


  ·  2xSM41 ( model 412 )

  ·  2xSM51 ( model 512 )

  ·  2xSM512 ( model 514 )

  ·  2xSM61 ( model 612 )

  ·  2xSM71 ( model 712 )

  ·  2xSM81 ( model 812 )

  And, as stated earlier, CPU modules in SparcStations 10 and can run a
  different clock speeds, the following ones __SHOULD__ work:


  ·  2xSM50

  ·  SM41, SM51

  ·  SM41, SM61

  ·  SM51, SM61

  ·  SM71, SM81



  How does it performs? Well, it is fast, really fast. Some of the java
  Demos can run faster on a dual HyperSparc 125Mhz 128MB ( ywing ) than
  on a dual celeron BP6 433@433Mhz 192MB ( calimero ). The same applies
  for the Gimp. When it comes to compiling calimero runs faster than
  ywing. Both computers running 2.2.16 kernel and calimero's hard disk
  subsystem is full SCSI.

  One important detail when you plan to have different CPU modules in
  your computer is to have the same kind of modules, you cannot mix
  SuperSparc and HyperSparc for example, but you can have an odd number
  of CPUs, for example 3. They are said to be able to run modules at
  different clock speed as written in this article form AcesHardware ,
  but I have not witnessed it.

  ywing has been upgraded to quad-CPU. You can read the kernel's
  message:

  As expected the best results are with make -j5 ( one instance per CPU
  + one ready to enter when a cache miss occurs ); then N increasing the
  results are starting to worsen.

  As a conclusion, those sun4m SMP systems will be very interesting when
  Gimp 2.0 will be available because of multitreading and paralelization
  of algorithms.

  If you want to learn more about SMP and Linux you can read the SMP-
  HOWTO http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SMP-HOWTO.html


  22.  The sound.

  The sound works fine on my SparcStation 20 and a 2.4.x kernel series.
  Most of the people I know report succes with the 2.4 kernel series.


  If you plan to use an older kernel, you can read the Linux/Sparc audio
  webpage at sparcaudio which is a very good source of information about
  Sound support on Sun's SparcStations.



  23.  Serial port.

  Sun workstations ususaly have 2 serial ports, but on sun4m workstation
  there is usualy only one serial connector at the rear, you need a
  special Y cable in order to have access to both ports.



  24.  Ressources.


  The following sites are given for your information, I am independent
  from them and does not represent them. If you would like to suggest a
  website or to add any information do not hesitate to email me.


  24.1.  Information sites.


  ·  Ace's Hardware: http://www.aceshardware.com/ An hardware
     information site having a SPARC area, actually the whole site used
     to run on a SparcStation 20 SM71, 128MB ! Ouaich, definitively not
     an Intel clone running Windows NTM.

  ·  ArsTechnica: http://arstechnica.com/cpu/index.html ArsTechnica is
     an information website with a good CPU section.

  ·  Black-Cube: http://www.black-cube.net/Sun/ Pictures of various
     SPARC hardware : IMHO great site.

  ·  LinuxDoc: http://www.tldp.org homesite of the LDP.

  ·  Obsolyte: http://www.obsolyte.com/sunPICS/ Nice pictures from
     various sun Hardware.

  ·  SPARC International, Inc.  http://www.sparc.org/ As the name
     implies, a lot of information about SPARC architecture.

  ·  Sun: http://docs.sun.com/ the starting node to access documentation
     on Sun Microsystems website.

  ·  Sun's Linux webpage.

     ___________________________________________________________________
     http://wwws.sun.com/software/linux/compatibility/ultralinux/index.html

  ·  SunHelp: http://sunhelp.org A good source of information about Sun
     Hardware and Solaris OS. Has a lot of links and good documentation
     on site.

  ·  Just the Facts:
     http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Sun_Resources/Just_The_Facts/JTF.html
     plenty of "Just the facts" documents in .ps format.

  ·  UltraLinux: http://www.ultralinux.org/ If you need information
     about the Linux Kernel on SPARC architecture it is a very good
     place: "Bring your penguin into the Sun".



  24.2.  Auction sites.

  Among the various Auction websites available on the net you can try
  theses ones. Remember to be very cautious when you purchase hardware (
  see the Buying a SPARC computer section. )


  ·  Ebay: http://www.ebay.com Ebay, and its regional sites have got a
     lot of Computers.

  ·  Yahoo! Auctions: http://auctions.yahoo.com/ This is the well known
     site.


  24.3.  A Good  Provider based in France

  There exists a very reliable source of used Sun workstations in
  France: solutions-rl

  http://www.solutions-rl.fr



  25.  Thanks and Credits.



  25.1.  Thanks.


  Among the many people who showed me how great Unix and the Unix
  computers can be, some people have earned a special place I would like
  to thank them:


  ·  My "Vieux matou" Michel Fiolet. Who gave me my first acount on a
     real Unix machine, and took the time to answer my questions,
     showing me among other things how to take advantage of the
     hardware's feature.

  ·  Nathalie Sabbah. Who was always able to guess at the speed of light
     what went wrong and fixed it on the fly. And took time to install
     the tools I needed.

  ·  Yves Daignaux. Who among other things always welcomed my questions,
     and whose office was always open even late in the evening.

     Both of them beeing real Sysadmin and teachers from the trenches,
     have a very deep knowledge and understanding of both the Hardware
     and Software.

  Also many thanks to "old crocodile" virgile for the time he spent at
  the library helping me to get the big picture.


  25.2.  Credits.


  Some people gave a lot of time and ressource to help me with this
  project, hereafeter is their names sorted by alphabetic order:


  ·  <babyworm@atlas.korea.ac.kr> provides a translation into the Korean
     Language.
