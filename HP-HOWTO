  This document describes the use of products available in the [http://
www.hp.com] Hewlett-Packard (HP) catalog with Linux and some free software.
It gives the state of the support for hardware, software to use, answers to
some frequently asked questions and gives elements of sizing. The goals are
to offer a general view of free software functions and their use at best with
HP products; as well as to make new users of HP products rapidly operational
and also to allow others to choose their products knowing facts.

Chapter 2. Presentation of Linux and Free Software 

2.1. Some definitions

  Before going into more details in the presentation, it could be useful to
give some definitions of terms and software mentionned in that HOWTO. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.1. Free Software or Open Source software

A free software (or Open Source software) is a software distributed with its
source code, allowing its study, its transmission, its adaptation. The
problem, in english, is the use of free, which has both meanings of "at no
cost" and "without constraint". Here, it's the second use which has to be
considered, hence the use of Open Source. To remember, think of free as
speech, not beer. 

  Depending on the licenses used for its development, the constraints for
users of such a software are various. The most open licenses (like the BSD
one) allow code appropriation by third parties, including the resell of the
resulting software (with or without modification) in commercial products,
without any problem, and without owing something else to the originators than
the mention of their copyright. Other licenses (like the GNU Public License
or GPL) force every modified GPL software to be free GPL software itself ;
this doesn't allow the use of such programs in a commercial one. Many other
licenses exist, more or less open: the Artistic License (perl), the NPL one
(mozilla), the QPL one (Qt) ... 

  A vast majority of free software is today under the GPL license, even if
the BSD world takes always a great place, however less visible, mainly in the
press. Linux is placed under the GPL. To have more information on these
definitions and the licenses, please refer to the following reference sites :

[http://www.gnu.org] GNU project Web site
      You find there all information on the GNU project, including the
    licenses produced (GPL and LGPL) and various discussions on free
    software. 
   
[http://www.opensource.org] Open Source project Web site
      This site proposes a new definition, a bit less restrictive, of free
    software - called here OpenSource Software - by well-known people. 
   

[http://www.freebsd.org/] FreeBSD project Web site
      Here are explained the advantages of the very open BSD license. 
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.2. Examples and counter-examples

  First of all, free software and freeware shouldn't be mixed up. A freeware
is not necessarily a software provided with its sources, on the contrary of a
free software. On the other side, on the contrary of a freeware, you may be
charged to obtain a free software (it's not in contradiction with the license
used). The ambiguity, as stated before, comes from the word "free" . A
freeware is then free of charge, but not necessarily "free of sources". (As
well, the shareware has nothing to do with free software). 

  So examples of important and well-known free software are the Linux and
FreeBSD operating systems, the [http://www.apache.org] Apache Web server, the
[http://www.samba.org] SaMBa SMB server, GNU C and C++ compilers ... A
contrario, examples of well-known freeware are the Internet Explorer browser,
the Eudora Light mail reader, ... 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.3. Linux

Linux is a free operating system, superset of the POSIX norm. "Linux" points
out the kernel alone. By extension, the name is also given to distributions
based on that kernel plus a set of tools from the GNU project. 

  Linux is by consequence a Unix system, except that it doesn't use any
proprietary code and is furnished under the GPL license, implying the
availability of the sources. As every Unix system, Linux is multi-tasking and
multi-user. It's also extremely portable, and it is available officialy today
on processors such as Intel (i386 to Pentium IV), Alpha, Motorola (680x0 and
PowerPC), Sparc, StrongArm, Mips. Without mention of the ports, operational
or in process on PalmPilot, Itanium (ex-Merced), PA-Risc, Crusoe ...

  The system is today perfectly stable and mature. Versions "x.y.z" of the
Linux kernel, where "y" is an even number, are stable and only bug
corrections are generaly applied when "z" increases. Versions "x.y.z" of the
Linux kernel, where "y" is an odd number, are development versions which may
be instable and are reserved to developers or intrepids. 

  From time to time, when the kernel development stabilizes a "freeze" is
announced to furnish a new "stable" version (even), and the development goes
on on a new version (odd). 

  The current stable version is the version 2.4.16 (this last number may
evolve following the rythm of corrections). Development has on the other side
begun again with a 2.5 version. 

  Numerous presentations of Linux are currently available. Among them, you
should consult the one made by Michael Johnson at [http://www.linuxdoc.org/
HOWTO/INFO-SHEET.html] http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/INFO-SHEET.html 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.3.1. Linux technical characteristics

  The system offers the following technical characteristics : 

  *   Multi-tasking : executes several programs in pseudo-parallel. 
   
  *   Multi-users : many users acting on the same machine at the same time
    (without worrying on licenses). 
   
  *   Portable and interoperable : works on several hardware architectures.
    All the sources are available. Linux supports a lot of file systems,
    outside the native ext2 : System V, BSD, Sun, MS-DOS, VFAT, NTFS, Mac,
    HPFS, EFS, ISO9660. On the network side, it supports the following
    protocols TCP/IP v4 and v6, Appletalk, Netware (client and server), Lan
    Manager SMB (client and server), X-Window, NFS, PPP, SLIP, UUCP.
   
  *   Performant architecture : modular kernel, built at will, execution in
    protect mode on 80x86 processors, page load on demand, page share between
    executables when reading, virtual memory with swap on disk, use of a
    dynamical disk cache in memory, dynamic libraries, process management,
    pseudo terminals, virtual consoles. 
   
  *   Security : protection of memory between processes: one user program
    can't compromise the whole system operation. The kernel may also, on the
    other hand, filter network packets. 
   
  *   Respect of norms and standards : Posix, with System V and BSD
    extensions. Support of COFF and ELF binaries. Binary compatibility with
    SCO, SVR3/4 through the iBCS2 module. Native Language Support as well as
    national keyboards, fonts... 
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Free software concepts

  Once the definitions are given, it is important to stay on at ideas
promoted by the free software movement. It's important as well to clear some
wrong ideas hawked on these software. This section gives then a various set
of elements in favour of the introduction of free software and ends on the
real problems remaining to solve. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.1. Free software philosophy

  In fact, the philosophy promoted by the free software movement is not that
different from the one proposed by the scientific movement till a long time
already: to put in common ideas and collective knowledge to allow the
progression of the research and the growth of this knowledge. The knowledge
of the human genome is one of the examples of such a collaborative work. 

  The computer engineering environment, and especially the software one,
seems to have turn away till the last 20 years from these base concepts of
the scientific world. It prefers on the contrary to keep the customer captive
instead of giving him the information needed to exploit his computing
environment the best he can. That's indeed following such a problem at the
begining of the 80's that Richard Stallman, who was doing researches in
artificial intelligence at the MIT, decided to create the GNU project. This
project is the foundation of the current free software movement. 

  The main ideas promoted by this movement and stated by Richard Stallman
himself are : 

  *   Liberty: every user should be free to copy, diffuse, modify a program,
    either to share it with others, or to adapt it to his own needs. As well,
    he should be able to analyse it to understand, imitate, improve, verify
    its operations, as well as every scientific result is published and seen
    by the peers for verification, study, understanding and realisation of
    derived works. Could you imagine a vaccine against the liver cancer that
    another laboratory couldn't derive to make a vaccine against the pancres
    cancer. Of course, the negative impact of patents at that level is
    obvious. 
   
  *   Equality: every person should have the same rights on the software.
    Thus the provider isn't priviledged and can't keep customers to whom he
    furnished his work captive. Could you think that only the producer of our
    vaccine could use it ? With software patents, if you don't pay, you
    cannot use them (think to discussions around RANT and W3C standards). 
   
  *   Fraternity: this mode of working encourages the whole computer
    engineering community to cooperate and thus to produce software more and
    more reliable and useful to all. Could you imagine that a discovery like
    the vaccine above couldn't help everyone and favour other discoveries.
    Again with software patents, nothing like that is possible. 
   

  More over the utopy of these ideas, we can find other reasons which allowed
free software to spread so widely today. They are detailed in Section 2.2.2.

  The free software movement materializes itself also through a community of
people. That community, informal meeting of personnalities, is heterogeneous
in its contents, actions, ideas, even if all share the same belief in the
freedom of the software. That community created for itself the tools needed
to its communication : Internet and Usenet. And these communication tools are
based of course on a lot of free software to work. Among the outstanding
persons of this movement, we can present : 

  * [http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/~torvalds/] Linus Torvalds, conceptor of
    Linux. 
   
  * [http://www.gnu.org/people/rms.html] Richard Stallman, GNU project
    conceptor. 
   
  * [http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr] Eric S. Raymond, writer of several and
    excellent articles, which inspired so many vocations. 
   
  * [http://kiev.wall.org/~larry] Larry Wall, author of Perl and of the patch
    tool, and philosopher. 
   
  * [] Alan Cox, mister "do everything". 
   
  * Tim O'Reilly <ask_tim@oreilly.com>, free software advocate and editor of
    several books dedicated to them. 
   

  All these personalities are, above all, excellent computer engineers, which
allows them to be recognized as major actors of the free software movement.
Their human and communication qualities are also strong characteristics of
their nature. In any case they aren't considered for their power, but for
their knowledge. 

  Of course, the free software community is built of thousands of
programmers, whose complete list would be too tedious. All share the will of
producing useful work, free, and to be recognized for their technical
qualities above all. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2. The choice of free software

  To use free software to bring solutions in a computing environment is a
choice. First, it is in favour of a plurality of solutions, mainly in the
personal computer world which tends to be monopolistic. Then, the choice is
made, and that's what is finally important, on the own qualities of free
software, which are detailed just below. 

Source code access
      This point is the most important of the choice, because it allows the
    undestanding, adaptation, correction, distribution, improvement of the
    software. 
   
Reliability
      That quality is derived from the previous one: the free software is the
    combined result of the experience and the intelligence of all the
    participants. Its reliability increases then as time passes, with all the
    corrections which are made. More over, no marketing pression requires the
    software's producer to deliver it to its customers before it is in a
    satisfactory state. 
   
Portability
      This quality is not intrinsic to free software, but is very often seen
    in a free software. Indeed if a softawre meets success, it will
    necessarily be adapted to other environments than those initialy
    considered. Thus by increasing its disponibility, its portability and
    reliability are also increased. linux works today on a HP Jornada or IBM
    watch, as well as on s390 or SuperDome.  
   
Universality
      One essential quality of free software is the character naturaly
    universal of the data format used. Even if they don't follow standards,
    the availibility of the source code assures the user that he will
    understand them, and more over be able to write any filter needed to
    reuse these data or exchange them with other software. This allows also
    users to stabilize their environment, because they are not required to
    migrate due to incompatibility of data formats in their applications.
    Don't forget that your data are precious ans thet it's better to archive
    them under a *ML format (HTML, XML, SGML, ...) rther than a proprietary
    one. 
   
Performance
      Resulting from a lot of examinations, the use of algorithms coming from
    advanced research works, as well as tested by various usages, free
    software have good performances by nature. Frequently large portions of
    code are rewritten to allow the reuse of the original ideas with a better
    code and thus to increase performances. Several tests made by various
    organisms tend to prove it also

      Once more, there is no obligation to diffuse an application whose
    performances would be bad. 
   
Interoperability
      Interoperability is a reality of today's enterprises. Historically,
    Unix environment was always a ferment for interoperability with other
    systems (big or medium size systems, as well as personal computers). The
    support in Linux, for example, of a lot of network protocols, filesystem
    formats, and even binary compatibility modes assures a good
    interoperability. By the way, interoperability requires 2 actors, and
    having only one open is generally not sufficient. That's the goal of
    having RFCs, norms, standards, ... 
   
Reactivity
      When considering the more and more longer development cycles of the
    software editors, the reactivity brought by the free software movement is
    interesting for a lot of sites, concerned by the rapid obtention of
    corrections to a given problem. Thus, during the recent discoveries of IP
    problems (ping of the death,...), patches were always available within
    the next 3 days. And above that, only the patch correcting the hole found
    was delivered. There were no functionality added, which could have create
    other instabilities. 
   
Security
      The best computing security possible is ensured by a robust
    construction, public and reknown algorithms, a quick communication around
    flaws, ... In other words by transparency. Obscurity is in this domain
    bad, useless and even dangerous. In the free software world, the
    reactivity described in the previous paragraph is a garanty of increased
    security, ... at the condition that patches are applied regularly. 
   

  Independantly of its qualities, it's possible to give other reasons of
various nature, in favor of free software, depending on the type of the
person met.

2.2.2.1. Marketing argumentation

  Studies from IDC bring to light the irresistible rise of Linux as a server
operating system. In 1998, Linux is credited with 17% of market share, with
an increase of 212%, which is the most important in that domain. The
following graphics give the whole market share repartition. 

Figure 2-1. Server operating system repartition in 1998 (IDC). 

[idc1998]

  This was confirmed in 1999 with a market share climbing to 24% and an
ancrease of 93%, always more than four times the increase of the follower.


Figure 2-2. Server operating system repartition in 1999 (IDC). 

[idc1999]

  Dataquest [http://gartner6.gartnerweb.com/dq/static/about/press/
pr-b9939.html] estimates on its side that Linux servers will represent, with
1.1 million of units, 14% of the servers sold in 2003. 

  The Net itself produces marketing tools to demonstrate the superiority of
free software. Counters are regularly updated by [http://www.netcraft.com/
survey/] Netcraft and others, on web server software, and another was done by
[http://www.leb.net/hzo/ioscount/index.html] IOS Counter for the servers on
Internet. Results, reproduced below, show the importance taken by [http://
www.apache.org] Apache with more than 16 millions of operational sites (among
them 30% run Linux), crushing the competition, as well as the free operating
systems Linux and *BSD which dominate the world of Internet servers.

  A detailed explanation based on the most precise numbered results is also
regularly updated, showing the advantages to use free and open source
software, Cf: [http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html] http://
www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.2. Financial argumentation

  Financial factors also speak for free software. And first the price to
aquire them is low. Low, because it's never zero. Even if you can find it on
the Internet, you have to consider the costs related to that link. However
costs are greatly less expensive than for commercial software. So a RedHat
7.2 Linux distribution, delivered with more than 1400 software packages,
costs about 60 USD when you have to pay more than 800 USD to obtain Windows
2000 server, delivered only with IIS. 

  On the other side, free software don't have the notion of license by user
or by supplmentary service. Thus there is no additional cost when you have to
increase the use of these software in your entity. That's of course not the
case with commercial software whose economical logic is often based on the
number of licenses. 

  Free software bring in addition a better mastering of the TCO (Total Cost
of Ownership), mentionned so frequently in the massive deployment of personal
computers. Thus administration costs are reduced because systems like Linux
or FreeBSD, as Unix, are managed completely remotely, either through command
line orders (with telnet or ssh) or in graphical mode by using X-Window. More
over, we benefit from a true multi-users mode, improving these management
operations. Always in this domain, it's also possible to do remote
management, either through the own hardware capacities of the machine (as the
Remote Assistant card integrated in most HP NetServers), or by doing a remote
connexion (through modem, ISDN adapter or a permanent link) thanks to the
native PPP protocol and secure connexion systems as tunneling or ssh. This
managemnt could even be realised by an external entity, in outsourcing. 

  At last, the costs due to the hardware themselves could be controled; on
one side, if by chance free software don't meet the needs, it's always
possible to buy then commercial software solutions to cover the rest on the
same hardware. On the other side, solutions based on free software have good
performances by nature, and can use hardware platforms which would be
considered as obsolete, if installed following the standard criterias of
other operating systems or applications. The fact to separate the graphical
interface from the rest of the working system is here key. It's so possible
to use "old" hardware, mainly to model. It's then possible to invest, with a
fine knowledge, when puting the solution in operation, if needed. The power
increase may naturaly take place progressively. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.3. Technical argumentation

  This argumentation was already given in the previous sections. I think
nevertheless that some notions may be explained with complementary
information. 

  So concerning the reliability aspects of free software based solutions,
it's important to note that it implies an operational running time very high
(standard characteristic of Unix systems in general). This is mesured by the
command uptime. One of Medasys and HP customers, Saint-Michel Hospital in
Paris, has a Vectra VL5 acting as router under Linux since more than 300
days. And that's not a isolated case. 

  Respect of standards and norms, as well as the extreme portability of free
software assures also to applications developed on these platforms the same
qualities. And notably, if after their use, the performances or services
brought by free software based architectures were insufficient (it may be
caused by architecture problems such as PCI bandwidth, number of processors
available, ...), it would be easy to migrate to machines offering more
performances and capacities of evolution, as the HP 9000 systems, running
HP-UX. 

  At last a development plan centered around performances implies a
modularity, such as it's possible to resize the system kernel nearest to the
capacities of the hardware or to use dynamically loaded modules following the
needs. A packages installation may vary from 40 MB for a minimal system up to
many GB for a complete distribution. The system linearity allow also the
support of multi-processors machines (SMP) (tested up to 32 processors on a
Sparc machine). The system modularity allows also to obtain an operational
system on a 1.44 MB floppy disk, either to realize a minimal repair
environment, or to provide a perfectly operational router. The world of
embedded systems shows besides more and more interest for systems such as
Linux, because above it's modularity, source availability makes communication
with dedicated peripherals easier (acquisition cards, sonde, ...). Entities
as CERN or Thomson already use such solutions. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.4. Solutions argumentation

  That argumentation is probably the most important of all, because it's
useless to have free software if it's not to make something useful with it or
to offer solutions to demands of entities willing to use it. In which sectors
free softawre may bring solutions today ? Well, you have to admit it's in
nearly all the sectors of enterprise computing. 

  Historically, Open Source Software were used to realise Internet/Intranet
servers, because their growth was following the one of the Net. It's so
possible to cover all aspects linked to the Internet, from the Web server (
[http://www.apache.org] Apache ), FTP server ([http://www.landfield.com/
wu-ftpd] Wu-Ftpd), DNS server ([http://www.isc.org/bind.html] Bind), the
E-Mail server ([http://www.sendmail.org] Sendmail or [http://www.postfix.org]
PostFix ), the Usenet groups server ([http://www.isc.org/inn.html] INN), the
proxy server ([http://juanjox.linuxhq.com/] IPmasqadm), the firewall ([http:/
/www.rustcorp.com/linux/ipchains/] IPChains or [http://netfilter.samba.org]
IPTables), Virtual Private Network ([http://www.openssh.com/] OpenSSH), the
Cache server for the Web ( [http://squid.nlanr.net/Squid/] Squid ) or also
the Time server ([http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp] NTP) or as directory
service([http://www.openldap.org] LDAP) server, or as content management
([http://www.midgard.org] Midgard) server ... All these software are
available in standard in a Linux distribution. The client computer should be
equiped with the software corresponding to the application used (mail reader,
news reader, web browser, ...) whatever its operating system. The choice of
the client is free, as all these tools respect the standards decreed in the
[ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/rfc] RFCs.

  The second preferential domain for free software is the file and print
server domain. For these services, clients may be multiple: Unix type (use of
[ftp://ftp.mathematik.th-darmstadt.de/pub/linux/okir] NFS and [ftp://
ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/gcc/] KNFS or also [http://
www.coda.cs.cmu.edu] Coda and [http://www.inter-mezzo.org] Inter-Mezzo, for
file sharing and of lpd or [http://www.cups.org] CUPS for print service),
Microsoft Windows type (use of [http://www.samba.org] SaMBa , which allows
also the use of local client printers), Novell type (use of [http://
www.compu-art.de/mars_nwe] Mars_nwe) or MacIntosh type (use of [http://
www.umich.edu/~rsug/netatalk] NetAtalk). All these software are provided in
standard in a Linux distribution and don't need any modification at the
client level to work. 

  The other domains where a system such as Linux may bring solutions is the
computation one, with support of [http://www.irisa.fr/prive/mentre/smp-faq/]
multiprocessor, linked to the realisation of [http://hp-linux.cern.ch/]
clusters with multiple nodes with [http://www.mosix.org] Mosix or [http://
www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Beowulf-HOWTO.html] BeoWulf with high-speed network
interfaces (100 Mbit/s, [http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/index.html
#gigabit] Gigabit or [http://lhpca.univ-lyon1.fr/myri.html] Myrinet); those
of data security with the support of HP NetRaidRem. cards, allowing Raid
level of 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 50, and HotSpare disks, managed by the harware;
those of centralized fax server, with a free software like [http://
www.hylafax.org] HylaFAX or also as an archive/backup server with HP
SureStore DAT or DLT libraries thanks to a GPL software like [http://
www.amanda.org] Amanda or a commercial one like [http://www.arkeia.com]
Arkeia or at last as a database server with free solutions like [http://
www.postgreSQL.org/] PostgreSQL,[http://www.mysql.org/] MySQL or commercial
like [http://platforms.oracle.com/linux/index_lin.htm] Oracle, to speak only
of these three. 

  On the client side, even if it's less highlighted for the moment,
possibilities to use solutions based on free or commercial software are
numerous. Here also the Internet part is the main one, with tools like
graphical web browsers ([ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/] Netscape,
[http://www.mozilla.org] Mozilla or [http://www.konqueror.org] Konqueror) or
textual ([http://www.cc.ukans.edu/about_lynx/about_lynx.html] lynx or [http:/
/www.w3m.org] w3m), a lot of graphical mail readers ([http://
www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/6702/kmail.html] Kmail, [http://
burka.netvision.net.il/xfmail/xfmail.html] XFMail, ...) or textual ([http://
www.mutt.org/] mutt, [ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/mail/elm] elm, ...). But
you also have the whole panel of indispensable tools for a personal computer
today as a PDF reader ([http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/custsupport/

([http://www.gnome.org] Gnome, [http://www.kde.org] KDE, [http://

...). The evolution of these last tools indicates that the 2000's may be the
years where Linux and free software will break through at their turn on the
client. 

  I want to mention that this document was realised on an HP Brio BAx, then
on a Vectra VL400 equiped only with a Linux distribution, with the help of
tools like [http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook] DSSSL style sheet,
[http://www.netfolder.com/DSSSL/index.html] OpenJade and [http://
www.oasis-open.org/docbook/] DocBook, [http://www.vim.org] ViM which allowed
to generate from a single source the formats HTML, Txt, RTF, PostScript, and
PDF.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.5. Service argumentation

  This one was for a long time a blocking point to the expansion of free
software in the firms. It's not the case today. Many service providers or
hardware manufacturers, like HP, control today these solutions and propose
support around them, uoto missions critical if requested. 

  Other sources of information are also available, in abundance, through
several web sites dedicated to these solutions, specialised mailing-lists,
and various Usenet groups, such as for Linux, the international groups under 
comp.os.linux.* or for the french speaking people under fr.comp.os.linux.*.

  Concerning competences, more and more young engineers or academics finish
their learning cycle being trained to the use of free applications and
operating systems. This wealth of competences arrives now on the labour
market and will contribute to increase the movement of generalisation of
these tools. At last, many firms have internaly ignored competences. In fact,
their employees often install this software at home, and have a good
mastering, usable when arrives the deployment of the software in their
professional structure. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.3. Wrong ideas on free software

  Advocating free software consists also to mention some generally accepted
ideas concerning them and to fight them. 

"There is no support, no training"
      As seen previously, support is currently structuring itself. A firm
    like [http://www.redhat.com] RedHat provides today support for their
    solutions. Only in France, we may mention firms like [http://
    www.medasys.fr] Medasys , [http://www.atrid.fr] Atrid, [http://
    www.alcove.fr] Alcove which assure support on free software. Likewise,
    always in France, training on free software may be given by [http://
    www.france.hp.com/formation] HP France, [http://www.learningtree.com/fr/
    index.htm] Learning Tree, the [http://form-continue.iut-velizy.uvsq.fr/]
    IUT de Vélizy, without mentioning generic network and Unix trainings
    (besides proposed also by the same organizations) which represent a
    fundamental base in a training course. And at last, we should mention the
    ability of each of us to self-train, mainly thanks to the huge
    documentation available (See the Chapter 7).
   
"There is no documentation"
      There is a whole set of manuals, the [http://www.linuxdoc.org] Linux
    Documentation Project, made of FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) and
    HOWTO, counting more than 300 documents around Linux, the main being
    [http://www.traduc.org] translated in french, and [ftp://ftp.linet.gr.jp:
    /pub/howto-translations] in japanese available as free documentation.
    This documentation has a various quality, more or less up to date,
    following the subjects, certainly but it makes a corpus allowing to
    apprehend alone a Linux distribution and all its components. For myself,
    I always found in it everything I needed to do my job with free software.
    And, in case of complementary information, a lot of web sites and Usenet
    groups may again bring some of the elements needed. And without counting
    the innumerable manual pages available on line. Each distribution comes
    also with a comprehensive set of manual covering all the tasks of
    installing, handling and managing them. 
   
      On the other side, the editors [http://www.editions-oreilly.fr]
    O'Reilly and [http://www.ssc.com] SSC have specialised in providing books
    around free software, written generaly by the writers of the software
    themselves. Their books are considered as reference books in their
    respective domains. 
   
"A free or nearly free product is a toy"
      You should always make a difference between free (as speech) and free
    (as beer). Too many freeware in Microsoft environment are in fact toys
    and of poor quality. It's absolutely not the case for free software, as
    stated in the previous sections. Remember just that they are reliable by
    construction. 
   
"Linux is difficult to install"
      Linux is a professional operating system. At that title, it requires
    competences to install it, as well as any other professional operating
    system, like the other Unix or Windows NT for example. But it isn't more
    difficult to install than those either, mainly thanks to distributions as
    RedHat, Mandrake, ... You need about 30 minutes to realize a complete
    installation of such distributions, so quite the same as for HP-UX and
    noticeably less than for Windows NT Server. 
   
      On the other hand, as before installing a server with Windows NT you
    have to verify its compatibility with the [http://www.microsoft.com/HCL]
    Hardware Compatibility List of Microsoft, for Linux it's also greatly
    recommended to verify the [http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/
    Hardware-HOWTO.html] Hardware HOWTO, and for HP machines to refer to 
    Section 3.2.
   
"Free Software are not adequate for heavy tasks"
      This is less and less true and this criticism has been obsoleted with
    the latest versions of the Linux kernel which will include a journalised
    filesystem, allowing a true application cluster. But already Linux
    authorises the use of multi-processors, several nodes to realise
    computation clusters. And don't forget it's used by the portal [http://
    www.voila.fr] Voila (France Telecom) or the engine [http://
    www.google.com] Google among other prestigious references. As well,
    FreeBSD is used with success as the world biggest ftp server : [ftp://
    ftp.cdrom.com] Walnut Creek CDROM server Useful projects to consult in
    this area of high availability are [http://www.linux-vs.org] http://
    www.linux-vs.org, [http://www.opengfs.org] http://www.opengfs.org and
    [http://www.linux-ha.org] http://www.linux-ha.org
   
"What appeal do I have in case of problem with the editors ?"
      There is no appeal, because software licences deny all responsabilities
    for the writers, in case of problem. But, in reality developers are
    always ready to help in case of problem and try to correct as soon as
    possible the bugs encountered (for the F00F bug of the pentium, a patch
    for the Linux kernel was published within 3 days, for example). On the
    other side, commercial editors guarantee very badly users against
    problems other than packaging errors. Please read the notes furnished
    with your software to judge. 
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.4. Real problems around free software

  It would not be honest to negate certain remaining problems linked to free
software. Some have begun to disappear, other are inherent to the system,
other at last will take time to diappear. 

  The first problem, inherent to the model of free software, is the
multiplicity of tools and distributions available. So, if you want to setup a
mail server, you have to choose between Sendmail, Exim, PostFix, Qmail,
Smail. As well if you want to install Linux, you may choose between the
distributions [http://www.redhat.com] RedHat , [http://www.suse.de] SuSE,
[http://www.slackware.com] Slackware, [http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en]
Mandrake, [http://www.turbolinux.com] Turbo Linux, [http://www.debian.org]
Debian. This represents often a problem for the newcomer, but the esperienced
user will always prefer to have a large choice he will confront to his
particularities and to his experience. As long as an actor respects the rules
by freeing his code (it's the case of the rpm and deb formats for example),
there is little risk from the comunity point of view. The key point is that
the choice is made only taking in account technical criterias. 

  The second problem, inherent also to the free software birth, is the
necessity to have strong Unix and Internet competences, to manage such
solutions. The power available through these systems is proportional to the
competence of their administrators. And that will stay true even with the
growth of more and more grahical solutions to manage them. On the other side,
you capitalize the investment in time to learn their functions and that
doesn't disappear, because you don't have to re-learn eveything from one
version to the other (I use the same editor, vi, for the last 15 years).
Don't forget that systems you use daily seem to be simple, uniquely because
you passed enough time to learn them. For Internet competences, it's a
statement of the obvious to say that this investment isn't lost. At last,
even with the work of translators to provide information in french and other
languages, a good knowledge in technical english is definitively a plus. 

  The last problem met in the implementation of free software solutions is to
suceed in convincing some managers to go against the prevailing opinion. The
aim of this chapter is precisely to give all sorts of argumentations to
achieve that goal, but you need each time to show conviction to get his way
in the end. As soon as these solutions will be adopted by big firms
principaly, resistances will disappear. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3. Linux and other operating systems

  The aim is not to examine completely or to compare the functions of the
various operating systems available. It's more upon looking at the respective
positions of Linux in comparaison with other systems. Only systems having a
sufficient representation on the market are considered. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.1. Linux and other proprietary Unix (HP-UX, Tru64, AIX, Solaris, Irix)

  The situation taken by all the hardware manufacturers places Linux today in
the entry level (when it's taken in account) and their own Unix system in the
middle and high level. Reality is sometimes more cruel than the situation
wanted by the marketing department :-). Technically, a Linux distribution has
no cause to be envious of the manufacturers Unix solutions, except for the
moment the set of commercial applications and some high-end hardware
configuration support. And we can often see that users dope their Unix
workstations with free software to complete their usage. 

  To be precise in the talk, we should consider manufacturers Unix solutions
as split in stations and servers. 

  On the station side, there's no doubt in my mind: for a customer, the only
reason today to buy one is linked to the availability of a software or a
hardware which wouldn't exist in the free environment, or due to intrinsic
performances of the machine. In the first case, we can see that this argument
should have a short life time, because logically every software editor
(except maybe hardware manufacturers) and every hardware manufacturer has
interest in porting their applications or allowing the use of their hardware
on all the major environments in the market. As shown by Oracle, Informix,
Sybase, ... Linux becomes today one of the major environments. In the second
case, the difference in term of performances between the Linux dominant
platform (IA-32) and the other competitors decreases and will disappear with
the generalisation of the IA-64 architecture, which seems to be adopted
largely by a majority of actors. More over, Linux is often available natively
on the processors of these actors (Sparc, Mips, PowerPC, 68xxx, Alpha,
Crusoe, PA-Risc). I think Linux may represent the famous unique and standard
Unix that everybody dreamed of from a long time, without succeeding to impose
it (the open and free characteristics brought by Linux are not without
influence on that). I think that at the end hardware manufacturer Unix
workstations will be restricted to some niches such as high end computation,
virtual reality, ... and that as long as solutions are not available on a
free environment. Linux offers all the functional qualities of the other Unix
systems, and thus of the workstation, on a more various hardware platform and
potentially at a better price, if on PCs. So it is the natural choice of
every computer engineer with a strong Unix culture (old customer of the
workstation) who will prefer that solution to the migration to a Microsoft
system typically. With IA-64, we can see that Linux was the first operating
system available (including graphical support). 

  On the server side, in addtion to the points mentionned previously for the
stations, problems are more complex. Ram, disks, processors capacities,
extensions of every kind make them difficultly repleacable by machines with a
IA-32 architecture for example. More over, certain solutions such as high
availability clusters for example have just been put in production in a Linux
environment, compared to years of operation under Unix. The other brake is
often linked to investments already done around software solutions deployed
on these servers. Whatever their natural life time is much higher than those
of the stations. Changes will thus be made more slowly in that domain. Here
we can consider rightly Linux solutions as an entry/middle level solutions,
when hardware manufacturer Unix servers are the middle/high level. The
introduction of Linux in place of these machines will begin only with a
massive availability of applications, mainly in the management sector. Again
IA-64, with increased SMP capabilities (16 processors today), higher
bandwidth, ... will make things change. 

  The advantages of the hardware manufacturer solutions, explaining why they
are so often chosen when applications are critical, are linked to the
homogeneity of the solution (hardware and software mastered by the same
entity, which can't invoke a third party in case of problem), and to the
support and maintenance guarantees furnished. 

  Finally, there is not so much antagonism between these systems, because
they are full cousins. Their association allows today to computer teams
"pro-Unix" to have solutions from start to finish, without having to lose in
functions, as it's so often the case with other operating systems available
for personal computers. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.2. Linux and SCO/Caldera

  The comparaison between Linux and the SCO systems seems to me quite
unbalanced. First, all the previous points are vaild here also. More over,
SCO isn't a hardware manufacturer, so the homogeneity advantage disappears.
The IA-32 Intel platform is supported by both systems, so cost is identical.
On the other hand, the software solution has a disproportionate cost (few
software provided in the base install, thus a lot of expenses to extend, as
well as to increase the number of users). Having to manage one OpenServer, I
can say that performances are far beyond those of a Linux system. More over,
its conception is older, abounds of symbolic links which makes management
complex. The hardware supported by SCO is less numerous than those Linux
supports. Only stay as an advantage the installed base and the set of
applications available. But for how long ? Caldera now owns both SCO software
(Openserver and Unixware) and its own Linux distribution. But instead of
trying to free technologies from SCO, they are proprietarizing their linux (1
license per server). 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.3. Linux and Windows NT/2000/XP

  The comparaison is here more difficult, because Windows NT/2000/XP isn't an
open system, as the precedings, which is already redhibitory for certain
users. An excellent [http://unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/] comparaison was made by
John Kirch between Unix and Windows NT Server. I recommend to people
searching to have an enlightened opinion on this subject to read it; it's
updated regularly and was written by a specialist of both Microsoft and Unix
operating systems. Financially, obvious advantage for the free software. And
it's more obvious, as for SCO, if you consider the set of complementary
software you need to use a server. The author evaluates the difference from 1
to 100 all the same ! Technically, either on the functions provided or on the
reliability, the administration, the performances, the hardware supported,
and more over the security, Unix systems and particularly free systems
outperform what is proposed by Windows NT/2000/XP. The fact to have a GUI non
independant from the kernel contributes greatly to the instability of NT/2000
/XP, because it's more difficult to avoid errors in a GUI (there is no
mastering possible of the user comportment in front of it) rather than in a
kernel. 

  Which are the real advantages of Windows NT ?: the marketing power of
Microsoft which persuades the world that computers equal Windows and which
leans on the enormous installed base; its office applications (a monopolistic
situation on the market) only available in this environment; the confusion
maintained between the various flavours of Windows (95/98, NT, 2000), and
between the server and client functions; its agreements with the biggest
hardware manufacturers which often require them to provide a Microsoft system
with their platforms; its technological initiatives to occupy the market in
first, based on proprietary code and that often without respect of known or
documented standards, or its policy to embrace for killing a movement
(described in the [http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html] "Haloween
documents").

  The lack of hegemony in the servers sector is the best reason to hope that
a plurality of solutions may exist in the future for computers users, also at
the desktop. The new XP licensing schema, the passport tool, the registering
mechanism during installation are real brakes for users thinking to migrate
from a current platform to a new one, as well as the hardware costs linked.
In that perspective, an opensource solution should and will be more and more
considered.

Chapter 3. Linux and HP products

 To maintain such a chapter is an endless task :-).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Informations on HP products and Linux

3.1.1. General information

  HP became recently concious of the importance taken by Linux and free
software in general, and on its machines particularly. Thus a web site
dedicated to Linux in HP environment is now available at [http://www.hp.com/
go/linux] http://www.hp.com/go/linux.

  In France, there is for a longer time a site on these themes, under the
responsability of Jacques Misselis <Jacques_Misselis@hp.com>, hosted by
[http://www.ec-lyon.fr] l'École Centrale de Lyon at the address [http://
hpwww.ec-lyon.fr/hpeduc/education] http://hpwww.ec-lyon.fr/hpeduc/education.

  On the other side, the firm Medasys for which I worked between 1996 and
2000, put at disposition of the community a certain number of information
since 1997, available at [http://www.medasys.fr/linux] http://www.medasys.fr/
linux. This HOWTO is the result of this work. 

  HP also realised a synthesis document (PDF format) concerning his position
in front of Linux, the [http://www.HyPer-Linux.org/HP-HOWTO/mirror/Docs/
white-paper.pdf] White Paper HP Linux Strategy (1999-04).

  HP is a member or sponsor of [http://www.li.org] Linux International,[http:
//www.osdlab.org] Open Source Development Lab, and [http://www.linuxbase.org]
Linux Standard Base.

3.2. HP hardware supported by Linux

  This section presents HP hardware supported today by Linux. Informations
are based on the latest stable version of the Linux kernel, which is
currently version 2.4.16. A development kernel (version 2.5) is also
available but doesn't offer any guarantee of stability. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1. Intel based computer range

  Page last updated the 2001-12-21.

  That computer range is today the main set of HP machines supported by
Linux, and that till many years. In case you didn't already do it before,
some preliminaty readings are recommended before to try to install Linux on
these platforms.

  The [http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO.html] Linux
Installation HOWTO contains a great number of information to install Linux.
If you bought linux on a CD-ROM, chances are that installation instructions
are provided with it (the little booklet inside the disk case, and/or files
on the CD). 

  The [http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html] Linux Kernel HOWTO
should be read to have details on kernel construction. I will just mention
here points which are specific to HP hardware. 

  Outside particular indication, Linux support means during the installation
of a RedHat/Mandrake type distribution. In special cases, a kernel rebuild
will be necessary to support completely some hardware elements. You should
note that what is true for one distribution is generally true for another, as
these functions are linked to the kernel or the XFree86 server, and not to
the distribution itself. 

  In case of problem, the first reflex should be to update the BIOS of the HP
machine, and to verify whether the problem is always there. If yes, you may
then contact HP support, if your configuration is supported by HP (This
document focus on what is working, superset of what is supported, and has no
value in that area). On the other hand, if your machine is working correctly,
don't update the BIOS without reason, this is always a risked operation. BIOS
updates are available from [http://www.hp.com/cposupport/software.html] http:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1.1. The desktop range (Brio, Vectra, Kayak)

  HP has a new program called "Freedom of Choice" on the whole desktop range.
Linux is thus one of the operating systems pushed by HP. Cf: [http://
www.hp.com/desktops/linux/] http://www.hp.com/desktops/linux/ and [http://
www.hp.com/pressrel/aug00/14aug00.htm] http://www.hp.com/pressrel/aug00/
14aug00.htm.

A [http://www.hp.com/desktops/linux/linuxfaq.html] FAQ is also available. 

  HP insures the support of certified Linux hardware by the following method
: all the machines have the [http://www.support.vectra.hp.com/vectrasupport/
indexes/Driver39.html] Diagtool utility. If this utility indicates a problem,
it's taken in account by HP maintenance. If it doesn't, it's considered as a
software problem and should be reported to the distribution provider.  

  The following tables indicate the state of Linux support by these platforms
:

3.2.1.3. The workstation range (Visualize, HP workstation)

  Visualize systems come in two flavors: the p and x class systems are
preinstalled, supported, and configured with Windows; the pl and xl class
systems are preinstalled, supported, and configured with Linux. There is no
hardware difference between the base systems, but the Linux image that is
preinstalled on the pl and xl is customized so that all drivers for the
systems are preconfigured -- there's no need to specify or tune the box and
drivers.

  CD-ROM, DVD and ZIP drives are supported by Linux kernel. Read the various
HOWTO for their use, following the interface type. 

  There are 4 supported graphics cards with XFree86 on HP x2000 and x40000
systems with Linux: SynergyPlus, Synergy2, Matrox G450, and FireGL2/4. There
are also 4 rpms that are associated with these cards and they must be present
on your system in order to have a supported graphics environment:
synergyplus, synergy2, firegl2 and mgag450. For example, to check for the
existence of the firegl2 rpm, run

  Once you have installed the new card and rebooted, run /usr/X11R6/bin/
graphicsconfig to configure the card. If it is a recognized card supported by
your Linux system, the function will return the name of the card and it will
be configured to run. At this point you may start up your X window
environment.  

  If it returns "UNKNOWN", then your graphics card either is not one of the 4
currently supported cards, or it is a newer/older version of the card than is
supported. In either case you will need to run Xconfigurator to set it up.

3.2.1.5. The mobile computer range (OmniBook)

  To suspend to disk the current session, you need to not have deleted the
hibernation partition (type a0), which size should be the size of the RAM, to
have support for APM in the kernel, and to use the key combination Fn+F12. 

  To send the video signal, either to an external screen, or through the
docking station, it is be necessary to add the following parameter to your
XFree86 configuration file /etc/X11/XF86Config:
[...]                                                                        
Section "Device"                                                             
[...]                                                                        
Options "crt_screen"                                                         
[...]                                                                        
This concerns mobile computers using ATI chipsets. The switch is done by
pressing simultaneously on Fn-F5. 

  Most of the OmniBook have in option a "Port Replicator" system allowing,
according to the model, to support PCI cards, complementary ports, ...

  For TopTools Remote Control Cards (TTRCC), the B.02.02 firmware release
shows some strange symptoms at boot time, namely you get no data in your
browser (Netscape on Linux) until way past selftest and LILO, so it's kind of
hard to boot an alternate kernel. The fix is to 'downgrade' your firmware on
the TTRCC to B.02.00. You can see what revision you're running on the
TopTools 'Identity Screen'. You can flash the eeprom on the TTRCC anytime
(unless you really want to make a DOS floppy and reboot) by tftping the right
firmware (ttrc0200.bin) in the 'Configuration' tab -> 'Card Info' area, and
press 'Update'. It takes a minute or so to download/verify/and reset the
TTRCC. (Information from Lee Mayes)

G450 card
      This card can support up to two displays. These displays can be
    configured in two different ways. 
   
      For uniquely independent screen operation, you can configure displays
    for "multi-screen" work. In this mode, the X server reports two
    independent screens for client connections. These are numbered using the
    "minor" display number (e.g. <hostname>:0.0 and <hostname>:0.1). There is
    no support to move client windows between the screens. 
   
      The other configuration option uses the XINERAMA extension. This
    configuration links multiple screens to behave as one logical screen. In
    this mode, the X server reports one screen for all client connections. X
    clients can move between screens and the overall screen resolution is
    doubled width or height depending upon the desired setup. 
   
      The following examples demonstrate these possibilities through the
    configuration file /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 :

    To enable the XINERAMA extension, you may use one of two ways. The first
    is by adding a command-line option to the X server. This can be done as
    follows:
    #startx -- +xinerama                                             
    The second method is by adding an option to /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 :
      Section "ServerFlags"                                          
        Option "Xinerama" "on"                                       
      EndSection                                                     
   
      The Matrox driver supports several XFree86 options through the file /
    etc/X11/XF86Config-4. The example below describes two such options that
    contribute to improved graphics performance:
      Section "Device"                                                           
        Identifier "Matrox G450"                                                 
            Driver     "mga"                                                     
    # Use this option to enable AGP 2X mode                                      
    # In default mode AGP 1x, the host to graphics bandwidth is about 500 MB/sec 
    # This will increase the host to graphics bandwidth to about 1 GB/sec        
    # This mode is recommended by HP for X2000/X4000                             
            Option     "AGPMode4x"    "on"                                       
    # Use this option to enable AGP 4X mode                                      
    # This will increase the host to graphics bandwidth to about 2 GB/sec        
    # This mode is recommended by HP for X2000/X4000                             
      EndSection                                                                 
   
ATI Rage Mobility video card
      The maximum resolution supported by this chipset in frame-buffer mode
    is 800x600 in 16 bpp (vga=0x315 in /etc/lilo.conf)
   
      This chipset is also supported by XFree 3.3.6 with the Mach64 driver
    and a patch available at [http://www.staikos.on.ca/~staikos/tp1460/
    XFMa64-Rage-Thinkpad.patch] http://www.staikos.on.ca/~staikos/tp1460/
    XFMa64-Rage-Thinkpad.patch.
   
      A precompiled X server is available at this address : [http://

FireGL 2/4 card
      This serveur is available from the ATI site at [http://support.ati.com/
    drivers/] http://support.ati.com/drivers/
   
      To enable multi-screen with FireGL4, set the monitor resolution to a
    supported multi-screen resolution like 2560x1024 in the /etc/X11/
    XF86Config-4 file. The firegl driver recognizes this and sets up
    multi-screen when the Xserver starts. Make sure you have two monitors set
    up and connected to the two DVI ports on the FireGL4 card. 
   
      The firegl driver supports several XFree86 options through the file /
    etc/X11/XF86Config-4. Values indicated in the example correspond to the
    default values.

GD 5465 video card
      To use a Cirrus Logic GD 5465 AGP card, with a version below Xfree86
    3.3.3, you have to use an option in the file XF86Config : Option
    "xaa_no_color_exp".
   
      Section example :
    Section "Device"                                                 
    [...]                                                            
           Identifier "CL-GD5465"                                    
           VendorName "Cirrus"                                       
           BoardName  "GD5465"                                       
           VideoRam   2048                                           
           Option     "xaa_no_color_exp"                             
    EndSection                                                       
   
      Some users who had problems with the support of this chipset were more
    satisfied with the use of the "sw_cursor" option. 
   
Elsa Gloria Synergy card
      Specifications of that card should be consulted on Elsa web site. This
    card is equiped with an hardware OpenGL accelerator. Under Linux, there
    is an OpenGL compatible layer called Mesa. This layer begins to support
    hardware accelerators, and among them the 3DLabs chipset which is on Elsa
    Gloria cards.

Silicon Motion LynxE card
      This card is only supported by the 3.3.6 version of XFree86 and upper.
    Nevertheless, even in that version, this is a preliminary support, which
    isn't as stable as the Frame Buffer mode. 
   
      On the other hand, to be able to install a RedHat 6.1 version, you
    should do that in text mode, because the server provided (3.3.5) doesn't
    support this card. 
   
      If you have a dual-boot system, booting first on Windows, and
    initialize the card through its driver seems to improve the operations
    then under Linux (warm reboot). 
   
      Versions of XFree86 above 4.0.2 also offer the support of this chipset.
   
Intel i810/i815 card
    (Informations provided by Frédéric Dubuy <F.Dubuy@atrid.fr>, Anne-Marie
    Mahfouf <a-m.mahfouf@lineone.net> and Jean-Bernard Chaffardon <
    Jean-Bernard_Chaffardon@hp.com>)
   
      These cards are only supported with a specific X server XFCom_i810/5
    downloadable in both format [ftp://download.intel.com/support/graphics/
    intel815/xfcom_i810-1.2-3.i386.rpm] RPM or [ftp://download.intel.com/
    support/graphics/intel810/xfcom_i810-1.2.patch.tar.gz] tar.gz and a
    complementary module for the kernel agpgart, downloadable in both format
    [ftp://download.intel.com/support/graphics/intel815/
    i810gtt-0.2-4.src.rpm] SRPM or [ftp://download.intel.com/support/graphics
    /intel810/i810gtt-0.1-6.src.tar.gz] tar.gz (old).
   
      Detailed documentations on the installation are provided at [http://
    www.linux-france.org/article/x/GuideIntel810/book1.html] http://
    www.linux-france.org/article/x/GuideIntel810/book1.html and [ftp://
    download.intel.com/support/graphics/intel815/release_linux.pdf] ftp://
    download.intel.com/support/graphics/intel815/release_linux.pdf
   
      To summarize, once the X server installed, the module compiled and
    installed, it's sufficient to modify with the following parameters the
    file /etc/X11/XF86Config :
    Section "Device"                                                 
    [...]                                                            
          Identifier "i810"                                          
    [...]                                                            
    EndSection                                                       
                                                                     
    [...]                                                            
    Section "Screen"                                                 
    [...]                                                            
          Driver "svga"                                              
          Device "i810"                                              
    [...]                                                            
    EndSection                                                       
   
      You have to note that the agpgart module provided by Intel should
    replace the one delivered in the kernel so that it works. You then have
    to reinstall it, particularly when a kernel update occurs.

Dual head with XFree86
      It's possible to use XFree86 in dual-head mode. The following example
    of configuration is provided by S. Eranian for a Matrox G200 AGP and a
    ATI Rage 128 PCI card. "The key element is that you must specify the PCI
    id for both cards."

D6692A card
      To use the D6692A card, you need to use a 2.1.122 kernel at least.
    Previous kernels didn't handled correctly the shared IRQ between the
    network and SCSI parts of the card. In particular, a standard RedHat 5.2
    version doesn't allow to the network part to be supported. You have to
    update your kernel with a recent one (preferably 2.4.16) and the
    distribution with the complementary packages needed.

e100 Intel driver
      A driver is provided by Intel to support its cards based on the PRO/100
    model, in its various versions. Depending on the model, you'll have a
    better support with this one, or with the standard eepro100 provided in
    the Linux kernel. It should allow a systematic support of the latest
    models. It's available at [ftp://download.intel.com/df-support/2896/eng/
    e100-1.6.22.tar.gz] ftp://download.intel.com/df-support/2896/eng/
    e100-1.6.22.tar.gz
   
      If you use the e100 driver, you could also use the ANS tools (Advanced
    Network Services) allowing you to do AFT (Adapter Fault Tolerance), ALB
    (Adaptive Load Balancing, including AFT), FEC or 802.3ad (Link
    Aggregation). For more details on these modes, please refer to the file
    associated with the file to download called readme.txt. It's available at
    [ftp://download.intel.com/df-support/2895/eng/ians-1.4.27.tar.gz] ftp://
    download.intel.com/df-support/2895/eng/ians-1.4.27.tar.gz
   
      To use this functionality, proceed as follow: 
   
    #ifconfig ethx down # For all adapters of the team                                     
    #ianscfg -a -tTEAM # Create the team                                                   
    #ianscfg -C -tTEAM -Mmode # Determine the mode of the team                             
    #ianscfg -a -tTEAM -methx # Add the interface ethx to the team                         
    #ianscfg -a -tTEAM -vveth0 # Create the virtual interface veth0 associated to the team 
    #ianscfg -c -tTEAM # Activate the team                                                 
    #ianscfg -w -f/etc/ians.conf # Save the configuration

DOS models
      These models are delivered with MS-DOS only, in order to have a Linux
    Machine at the best price. 
   
Turbo Linux models
      These models are delivered ready to be installed with Turbo Linux, in
    order to have a Linux Machine at the best price (2 CDs + 30 days of
    support). 
   
RedHat models
      These models are delivered preloaded with a improved distribution based
    on RedHat (shameless plug, as I did it :-) 
   
XU800
      On that machine, the Bios doesn't give the right amount of memory which
    is in the machine to Linux. You need to use a line such as append="mem=
    xxxM" at the begining of /etc/lilo.conf where xxx is your RAM in MB. 
   
      The support of "big size" IDE disks (for example, 27 GB disks provided
    for the XU 800) on these machines needs a kernel 2.2.15 at least. 
   
Omnibook XE
      If you intend to use both the sound chipset and a PCMCIA card in this
    laptop, in order to avoid conflicts at input/output ports level, you'll
    have to modify the file /etc/pcmcia/config.opts to change the line 6 to
    include port 0x300-0x4ff, port 0x1000-0x17ff                     
    The NSC PC87108/338 chipset controlling IrDA on this model is supported
    by the 2.4.16 kernel. (Source : [http://www.bits.bris.ac.uk/madmatt/
    laptop.shtml] http://www.bits.bris.ac.uk/madmatt/laptop.shtml)
   
      Some users had to apply the same tric for their Omnibook 4150 with
    success. 
   
Omnibook XE3
      It is recommended to not launch /sbin/halt under X11. The integrated
    modem card is not supported under Linux (ESS ES56CVM-PL).
   
      The installation of a RedHat 6.2 distribution gives a problem when
    rebooting the system, at the PCMCIA initialisation. You have to install
    the latest version of the pcmcia-cs package at [ftp://
    pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/pub/pcmcia-cs/] ftp://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net
    /pub/pcmcia-cs/
   
      To use the network with this distribution, you need a tulip driver
    modified by P. "goldpenguin" Depouilly, and available at [http://

Omnibook 4150
      If you use the Adaptec APA-1480 SCSI PCMCIA card, It must be in the top
    slot. If you don't put it in the top slot, the card that is in the top
    slot will not work. Also, even though the APA-1480 was supported long
    before this, the first time it worked on an Omnibook was kernel 2.2.16.
    There was some problems with the earlier cardbus drivers and the
    Omnibook. (Information from Bruce Kives)

B models
      B models use Ultra 3 SCSI sym53c1010 (A models use ultra 2). 
   
      To use the native SCSI bus of this machine, it"s necessary to use the
    sym53c8xx driver with a version upon 1.6c. A driver disk for RedHat
    distributions is available for versions [http://www.HyPer-Linux.org/
    HP-HOWTO/mirror/Drivers/dd61-sym.img] 6.1, [http://www.HyPer-Linux.org/
    HP-HOWTO/mirror/Drivers/dd62-sym.img] 6.2 and [http://www.HyPer-Linux.org
    /HP-HOWTO/mirror/Drivers/dd70-sym.img] 7.0.
   
      For the SuSE 7.0 distribution, you have to enter the manual mode to
    load the driver, as autodetection doesn"t work correctly. 
   
LC 2000
      In order to use the native SCSI controler you need to disable in the
    Bios the option "Reserve PCI Bus Numbers", in the menu PCI Device Setting
    (Indication of Gillynn Couch). Models P3493B and P5364B are equiped with
    an additional NetRaid 1M card.

LH 6000
      In order to use the native SCSI controler you need to desactivate in
    the Bios the "reserver PCI Bus #s", in the menu PCI Device Setting. The
    PS/2 system doesn't work correctly with a RedHat 6.1 or 6.2 distribution.
    In order to correct that you need to either put the machine in MPS 1.1,
    in the BIOS, or use a kernel above 2.3.47 in MPS 1.4 mode. The network
    card doesn't work correctly with the kernel of the RedHat 6.2
    distribution.

      Attention, the XF86_SVGA server works correctly with this mother board
    embedded version only above XFree86 3.3.5, due to the use of different
    frequencies (In particular, use the updates for RedHat 5.2/6.0).
   
Boot disk for 3Com card
    Creation of a custom RedHat 5.1 Boot disk
   
      To be able to boot with the RedHat 5.1 boot disk, and to have the
    support of the 3C905B-TX card, you need to do the following : 
   
    Log as root. Go in the home directory  (~root)

    Compile it                                                                                                                          
    #gcc -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O6 -c 3c59x.c `[ -f /usr/include/linux/modversions.h ] && echo -DMODVERSIONS` 
    put the RedHat 5.1 floppy boot disk in the drive                                                                                    
    you have to copy the initrd.img file from the floppy disk

3Com 996/Broadcom 5700 card (10/100/1000BT)
      This driver is provided with latest RedHat 7.1, 7.2/Mandrake 8.0, 8.1
    distributions, as kernel patches, but isn't included yet in the standard
    2.4 kernel. 
   
Boot/Driver disk for RedHat distribution
      To be able to boot with a RedHat distribution (>6.1), and to have the
    recognition of a peripheral non supported in standard in the
    distribution, you need to do the following : 
   
      Download the delopment toolkit to create driver disk for the RedHat
    distribution at the following address: [http://people.redhat.com/
    dledford] http://people.redhat.com/dledford
   
      Install the sources of the driver in a directory and follow the
    instructions of the README file of the kit to create the modules
    necessary for the various kernel of the distributions. 
   
    Log as root. (~root)                                                                                                                                                                                           
    put the RedHat floppy boot disk to modify in the drive                                                                                                                                                         
    you have to copy the initrd.img file from the floppy disk

LH 4
      The LH4 doesn't seem to work correctly when not in Raid. Even with the
    latest Bios available at the time of the test (16.00), the problem
    remains. If you desactivate the Raid management, during the boot, the
    ncr53c8xx driver in Linux detects 4 controlers instead of 2 and boot
    doesn't end. To avoid that, you have to activate the Raid in the Bios and
    use each of the disk in Raid0 mode, which is quite the same as the
    solution without Raid at all. 
   
      This machine can not be installed correctly with RedHat 7.1 or Mandrake
    8.0 distributions. 
   
NetRaid card
      These cards are equiped with an [http://www.ami.com] AMI Megaraid
    chipset and may support the following Raid levels : 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 30
    and 50.
   
      AMI has recently sold his Megaraid division to LSILogic and information
    is now available from [http://www.megaraid.lsilogic.com/] http://
    www.megaraid.lsilogic.com/
   
      Some NetRaid cards, as well as the chipset integrated on the LH3 and
    LH4 mother boards are supported by recent version of the Linux kernel
    (2.0.36/2.2.19/2.4.16 typically - don't use 2.0.37/38). 
   
      For the RedHat 5.2 distribution, it's not possible to install the
    system on this type of controler, because it's not detected by the
    installation program. You have to use a specific [http://
    www.HyPer-Linux.org/HP-HOWTO/mirror/Drivers/lh3.img] floppy disk . This
    floppy disk should be used as input to the rawrite tool, for example. It
    works for systems with less than 1 GB of memory. 
   
      For the RedHat 6.0 distribution, you have to manually declare the
    existence of this card as a supplementary SCSI adapter, in order to use
    it directly during the installation. The megaraid driver isn't
    automatically detected. 
   
      To avoid strange messages during the boot printed by the megaraid
    driver, it's necessary to recompile it with the option -DHP (before
    kernel 2.4.2) or -DMEGA_HP_FIX (after) or even nothing now (> 2.4.13). 
   
      For the RedHat 6.1 distribution, the megaraid driver provided by the
    kernel does support only the first logical drive. In order to obtain the
    others, please recompile a 2.2 standard kernel. 
   
      You have to note that the integrated card of the LH3/4 realises a
    software parity checks and performs thus less efficiently than the
    NetRaid daughter cards. On the other side, LH3000/6000 are equiped with
    an integrated card doing hardware checks. 
   
      In the driver provided by AMI there is a Raid management tool megamgr,
    usable within Linux, and equivalent to the tool included in the software
    embedded on the controler. It's downloadable from [http://www.ami.com/
    support/prodsearch.cfm?InpProdID=17] http://www.ami.com/support/
    prodsearch.cfm?InpProdID=17
   
      In case of problem, old versions are available there [http://
    www.HyPer-Linux.org/HP-HOWTO/mirror/Software/107.zip] http://
    www.HyPer-Linux.org/HP-HOWTO/mirror/Software/107.zip, [http://

    www.HyPer-Linux.org/HP-HOWTO/mirror/Software/1e08.zip and [http://

    www.HyPer-Linux.org/HP-HOWTO/mirror/Software/mega115.tgz,.
   
      Kernel patches and utility to monitor logical/physical drives on
    MegaRAID (NetRAID) Adapters have been made by Katsuyuki Yumoto. "This can
    detect physical drive failure, send E-Mail and syslog it. NetRAID-1Si/
    3Si, embeded NetRAID and NetRAID-1M/2M are okay to use. Don't use this
    for NetRAID-4M." You'll find the code at this address [http://
    www.jpn.hp.com/biz/products/pcserver/linux/tech/megascan-20011113.tar.gz]
    http://www.jpn.hp.com/biz/products/pcserver/linux/tech/
    megascan-20011113.tar.gz. Use with care as the versions I tried have
    conducted to kernel panic. 
   
      The NetRaid 1Si card isn't recognized correctly by RedHat 7.2. 
   
NetRaid 1M/2M models
      In addition to what is mentionned above, these models require a 1.14
    version of the megaraid driver to work correctly. You may find a version
    of the sources of this driver at this address [http://www.HyPer-Linux.org
    /HP-HOWTO/mirror/Software/ami-mr114b.tar.gz] http://www.HyPer-Linux.org/
    HP-HOWTO/mirror/Software/ami-mr114b.tar.gz.
   
      A driver disk for the RedHat distribution is available at the following
    address for the versions [http://www.HyPer-Linux.org/HP-HOWTO/mirror/
    Drivers/dd62-ami.img] 6.2 and [http://www.HyPer-Linux.org/HP-HOWTO/mirror
    /Drivers/dd70-ami.img] 7.0.
   
      To use a driver disk on a RedHat 6.2 distribution, you need to boot
    with the latest boot disk made by RedHat. Either by remaking a CD-ROM
    containing it, or by using it directly. It"s available at the following
    address [ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/updates/6.2/en/os/images/
    i386/boot-20000407.img] ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/updates/6.2
    /en/os/images/i386/boot-20000407.img
   
      You'll have data corruption by using these cards with the standard
    kernel of the RedHat 7.1 distribution. You necessaraly need [http://
    www.HyPer-Linux.org/HP-HOWTO/mirror/Drivers/dd71-ami.img] this driver
    disk to use it correctly. This has been seen with both H.01.07 and
    H.01.08 firmware. Sources of the patch required to make this card work
    correctly with kernels 2.4.x (x < 7) are available here [http://
    www.HyPer-Linux.org/HP-HOWTO/mirror/Software/mega115hp.tgz] http://
    www.HyPer-Linux.org/HP-HOWTO/mirror/Software/mega115hp.tgz. The same
    problème is true with the Mandrake 8.0, but the 8.1 has the right driver.
   
NetRaid 4M card
      These cards are equiped with a StrongARM Chipset and correspond to the
    Adaptec card AAC-3642. A driver is available at [http://domsch.com/linux]
    http://domsch.com/linux. The RedHat 7.0 includes in standard the driver
    even if that release of the kernel doesn't handle it normaly. Information
    are also available on the HP Navigator L.19.00. 
   
Second IDE bus
      On these machines, when the second ide bus is probed by the kernel,
    there is a timeout, which doesn't hurt, but is useless. To avoid it, just
    add to your lilo.conf the following line : 
   
    append="ide1=noprobe"                                            
   
Processors
      To desactivate processors on a Linux server, you need to give an option
    during the boot to the kernel such as : 
   
    Lilo boot: linux maxcpus=3                                       
   
      where the number of processors given in option is less by one of the
    number of processors wanted. For example, here we activate 4 processors. 
   
HA Cluster
      To use a High Availability Custer under Linux, you need to use
    additional software, such as :
   
      + [http://www.hp.com/products1/unix/highavailability/ar/mcserviceguard/
        index.html] HP MC Service Guard (Commercial)
       
      + [http://www.linux-ha.org] Linux-HA project (free) and [http://
        www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/ext3/] ext3
       
   
Multimedia keyboards
      Some of the PCs provided by HP are equiped with a multimedia keyboard.
    You may use the additional keys thanks to the HotKeys daemon (Cf: [http:/
    /freshmeat.net/projects/hotkeys/] http://freshmeat.net/projects/hotkeys/)

3.2.3. PA-Risc based computer range

  The PA-Risc range is achitectured around a processor designed and realised
by HP. First versions were produced in 1987. Currently the versions are named
PA-8000 (8200, 8500, ...).

  The initiative to port Linux on the PA-RISC architecture was taken during
the Atlanta Linux exhibition in October 1998. HP has announced in February
1999 its sponsorship to to this port of Linux. This port is a native one,
which is different from a preceding project which used MkLinux on machines
based on PA-7200. The work is currently done with [http://
www.thepuffingroup.com] The Puffin Group bought by Linuxcare, and more
precise information on the status may be found on the [http://
www.parisc-linux.org] official Web site. In particular, interesting starting
points may be found on [http://www.parisc-linux.org/faq.html] http://
www.parisc-linux.org/faq.html and [http://www.parisc-linux.org/hw.html] http:
//www.parisc-linux.org/hw.html. Consult also ESIEE site (712 on Linux/PA)
which participates actively to the port : [http://mkhppa1.esiee.fr/en/] http:
//mkhppa1.esiee.fr/en/ The last version is 0.9.3. It supports the following
systems L1000, L2000, A500, A180, B, C, J, D, R, 742, 725, 735, 755, 705,
710, 720, 730, 750, 712, 715.

  This version supports 32 and 64 bits modes, SMP (1-4 way), RAM up to 16 GB,
HP-UX compatibility, X-Window, KDE, Gnome, 80% of Debian packages. 

  Debian has accepted PA-RISC as a supported architecture for the upcoming
Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (woody) stable release. [http://www.debian.org/ports/
hppa/] http://www.debian.org/ports/hppa/.

Thomas Marteau has written a HOWTO on the way to boot concretely a Pa-Risc
suystem. It's available at [http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/
PA-RISC-Linux-Boot-HOWTO/index.html] http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/
PA-RISC-Linux-Boot-HOWTO/index.html.

1,1701,276,00.html.

  There is on the other side for these machines a Linux project based on the
MkLinux micro-kernel. This project as developped within OSF. The web site
mentionning information is at [http://www.gr.opengroup.org/mklinux/hppa/

3.2.4. The IA-64 range

  HP has developed in collaboration with Intel a new generation of 64 bits
processors called Itanium (IA-64). The first processor of this new
generation, called Itanium, was born in September 2001. The initial port of
Linux on IA-64 was published the 2nd of february, 2000 and the sources of the
project are available through [ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/ports/
ia64] ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/ports/ia64. This is the place of
the latest sources for this project. More information on this topic may be
found on these pages: [http://www.hp.com/products1/linux/itanium/index.html]
http://www.hp.com/products1/linux/itanium/index.html (LSO), [http://
devresource.hp.com/devresource/Topics/IA64/IA64.html] http://
devresource.hp.com/devresource/Topics/IA64/IA64.html and [http://
www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/index.html] http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/
index.html (HP Labs) or on the reference site [http://www.linuxia64.org]
http://www.linuxia64.org

  HP, as a founding member of the IA-64 Linux project, works on the port of
the kernel, the initial version of gcc, gas, ld and emacs. Another major
contribution of HP to this project is the availability of the software
development kit available at [http://www.software.hp.com/ia64linux] http://
www.software.hp.com/ia64linux. It allows to develop applications as well as
kernel code on Linux/IA32 for IA64 platforms and moreover to test them
through a simulator. 

  You may find some useful tools for IA-64 architecture on the ftp site of
the [ftp://ftp.hpl.hp.com/pub/linux-ia64] HP labs.

  Debian has accepted IA-64 as a supported architecture for the upcoming
Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (woody) stable release. Cf: [http://www.debian.org/ports
/ia64/] http://www.debian.org/ports/ia64/. The IA-64 installer CD image is
now available by either HTTP or FTP from these locations: [http://
gluck.debian.org/ia64/cd-20010810.iso.gz] http://gluck.debian.org/ia64/
cd-20010810.iso.gz and [ftp://gluck.debian.org/ia64/cd-20010810.iso.gz] ftp:/
/gluck.debian.org/ia64/cd-20010810.iso.gz.

MandrakeSoft has announced that its Mandrake 8.1 for IA-64 version supports
perfectly HP Itanium configurations as related on [http://
www.mandrakesoft.com/company/press/pr?n=/pr/products/1444en=en] http://
www.mandrakesoft.com/company/press/pr?n=/pr/products/1444en=en

  The following key features which are all unique to IA-64 are described by
Stéphane Eranian: 

  *   IA-64/EPIC goes beyond pure VLIW. Code is portable from one
    implementation to another. The timing dependencies are protected by stop
    bits. This allow unmodified code to run with no recompilation. Of course
    better performance is achieved by recompilation. 
   
  *   Very large register set: 128 floating point, 128 general registers. 
   
  *   Predication: a very elegant way of removing the cost of branch in
    if-then-else statments. 
   
  *   Speculation: a elegant mechanism to hide memory access latency by
    allowing load instructions to be hoisted from the location where they are
    needed without risking unwanted faults (like NULL pointer).  
   
  *   Register Stack Engine: a mechanism similar to the register window found
    a SPARC but much more powerful and dynamic. The window size varies on
    demand. Take advantage of the large register set and is used on function
    calls. 
   
  *   Hardware support for software pipelined-loop: this is the most powerful
    construct which takes advantages of : predication, large registers. This
    is a renaming scheme for general, floating point or predication registers
    which allows one to unroll loops without incuring the code expansion seen
    on other architectures. 
   
  *   All the multmedia-type instructions are support in IA-64 mode. 
   
  *   IA-32 hardware emulation: possibility to run unmodified Linux/ia32
    applications on Linux/ia64 (requires some OS support). 
   
  *   On the system level: full 64 bit address space. Hardware walker to TLB
    misses. 
   
  *   Banked registers (16 of them) to help speed up interrupt processing. 
   

Stéphane Eranian and David Mosberger will publish begining of 2002 a book
called 'Design and implementation of the Linux/ia64 kernel' (Prentice Hall)

Install your distribution as usual                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The only difference is that you need to create a so-called 'EFI' partition of type FAT32 (Id:b) of around 128 MB. This partition will be mounted as /boot/efi later                                                                     
After the installation, reboot and redo the initial sequence, verifying again the correspondance (which may have changed because the CD-ROM isn't available anymore, the numbers indicating the order of detection of bootable devices)

To automize the boot, you need to remove all options from the EFI boot except the EFI Shell and create a file in the EFI partition (/boot/efi) called startup.nsh containing:

(From information provided by S. Eranian. Only mistakes are mine :-) 

David Mosberger reports that recent versions (7.2) of Red Hat install a GPT
partition and that you must enable the following two config options for the
kernel to recognize them:
CONFIG_PARTITION_ADVANCED=y                                                  
CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION=y

3.2.5. X Terminals

  HP proposes now NCD X terminals to replace the Envizex/Entria range. 

  The HP X terminal range (Entria, Envizex) is usable with a Linux server.
More over, a Linux server may be a boot server for X terminals. To do it, a
certain number of operations are mandatory. 

  We suppose we have a HP-UX machine named hpux, on which is installed
Enware, a Linux server, named linux and an X Terminal with MAC address 08:00:
09:db:8d:1c. The gateway on the network is at IP address 192.168.1.254, and
the DNS name server at 192.168.1.1. 

  Commands to do are :
Enware Home Directory

3.2.6. The printing product range

3.2.6.1. General points

  Printers may be connected directly to a machine through either a parallel
port (generally), or a serial port, or even (more recently) through a USB
port. They may also be directly wired to the network, for a global access;
this is done thanks to a card put in a slot of the printer, or through the
connexion of the parallel port of the printer to a sharing network box. 

  HP provides such boxes, called JetDirect, which allow thus to share
personnal printers on the network, directly, without going through a machine.
They exist for various network topologies (10 BT, 10/100 BT, Localtalk, 10B2)
and offer the ability to access to the printer directly from machine which
like Linux support the LPD protocol, by using a remote printer in the /etc/
printcap file. The name of the queue to use is then raw.

  An example of /etc/printcap file allowing to access to a printer, equiped
with such a box or card, named lj4000 on the network is given below : 
# REMOTE POSTSCRIPT 1200x1200 a4 {} PostScript Default {}                                      
                                                                                               
lj4000::sd=/var/spool/lpd/lj4000::rm=lj4000::rp=raw::if=/var/spool/lpd/lj4000/filter::mx#0::sh:

  The configuration access to the box is done either through the WebJetAdmin
tool provided also under Linux now, or by the telnet command. The default
address of these products is 192.0.0.192. To connect to them initially, you
just have to add an IP alias on your network interface, typically by : 
#ifconfig eth0:0 192.0.0.1                                                   

  and a route to that network (if not automatically created) typically by :
#route add -net 192.0.0.0                                                    

  The access to the equipment is thus done simply by :
#telnet 192.0.0.192                                                          

  Please pay attention to have only one such equipment on the network, at the
same time, or you'll have duplicate IP addresses, which always causes
problems. Note that HP manageable network equipments also use the same
default address. The reading of the [http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/
IP-Alias.html] IP Alias mini HOWTO may be useful if you don't understand the
previous paragraph :-). 

  It is of course possible to access through the network to an HP printer
attached and declared directly on a Linux machine, thanks to the lpd service
for the other Unix clients, through [http://www.samba.org] SaMBa for the
clients of Microsoft systems (Win9x ou WinNTx) or through [http://
www.umich.edu/~rsug/netatalk] NetAtalk for the MacIntosh clients. 

  At last, [http://www.samba.org] SaMBa offers a tool, smbclient, which
allows to print from a Unix/Linux machine to a printer wired directly on a
Microsoft based PC, without any need to use a JetDirect system. All the
details useful to realize this operation are described in the example file of
smbprint provided with the [http://www.samba.org] SaMBa package and on the
page [http://www.medasys-digital-systems.fr/linux/samba-truc.html] http://
www.medasys-digital-systems.fr/linux/samba-truc.html.

  Communication between a Linux machine and a printer needs also, outside a
network dialog, a discussion with an exchange language between the two
elements. There are a lot of languages of that sort, such as PCL, Postscript
or HPGL. To be able to print correctly, the tool providing the datas to print
has to generate code known by the printer. Filters exist which allow to
easily transform an output in one given format to another one. Thus the
[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost] Ghostscript software authorizes the
transformation of Postscript source in a great variety of output formats, as
indicated by its invocation in the 'Available devices' part :

3.2.7.2. Digital photo cameras

  To use these peripherals, you have to compile SCSI support with your
kernel, and turn on mass storage device in USB support. Then mount the /dev/
sdxx device as usual. 

The following table provides all information on the support for this hardware
by Linux.

3.2.7.3. The Digital Sender

  This product is a scanner, able to send the result of the digitalisation
through e-mail, by sending the digitalised document as an attachement in PDF
format. It may so well be used with a Linux (or other) mail server (sendmail,
postfix, ...), as well as with clients reading their messages under Linux,
providing they have a tool to display PDF file such as [ftp://ftp.adobe.com/
pub/adobe/acrobatreader/unix/4.x/linux-ar-405.tar.gz] Acrobat Reader or
[http://www.aimnet.com/~derekn/xpdf/] xpdf.

  The Digital Sender can also send images as black and white or colour TIFF
files. The black and white images work fine, however, there is a problem with
the coloured TIFF files. These are sent in an obsolete format which is not
supported by [http://www.libtiff.org] libtiff, which is the basis of support
for the TIFF format for nearly all Linux software. This means that you cannot
directly open colour TIFF images created by the Digital Sender using Linux
software (e.g. The GIMP, ImageMagick). 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.7.4. The CapShare

  THere is an application for the Window Maker window manager to manage the
CapShare. More information at [http://www.netjunki.org/projects/index.php]
http://www.netjunki.org/projects/index.php
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.8. All-in-one range (OfficeJet)

  These products gather many functions : printing (all), scanning (all),
copying (all), and faxing (some). 

  More information from their dedicated web site : [http://
hpoj.sourceforge.net/suplist.shtml] http://hpoj.sourceforge.net/suplist.shtml
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.9. The Storage products range

3.2.9.1. Tape based products

  Most HP SCSI tape drives (DAT 1, 2, 3, 4, DLT, LTO) work with Linux. the
driver file to use is /dev/st0 for the first drive, /dev/st1, for the
second... 

  More information may be found on the certification site [http://
www.linuxtapecert.org/] http://www.linuxtapecert.org/

  HP provides the tapeware software with its drives, including a Linux
version. 

  Colorado Trakker 250 and 350 are supported with [http://
www.instmath.rwth-aachen.de/~heine/ftape] ftape (>= 4.02) T1000 should also
work correctly. Colorado 5GB are supported with the [http://www.torque.net/
parport/paride.html] paride driver.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.9.1.1. HP libraries

  Tools to manage such drives may be found on [http://mtx.sourceforge.net/]
http://mtx.sourceforge.net/ or [http://www.arkeia.com/] http://www.arkeia.com
/ or [http://www.strusel007.de/linux/changer.html] http://www.strusel007.de/
linux/changer.html. I had the chance to test models 6x24, 418, 718, 818 with
arkeia without problem. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.9.2. HP SureStore Virtual Array

  These systems are supported in a mixed environment Windows NT/2K, HP-UX
11.0 and Linux. They are connected through Fibre Channel controlers to the
SAN. Among all FC cards supported on Linux, HP supoprts those provided by
[http://www.emulex.com/ts/fc/docs/linuxframe.htm] Emulex and [http://
www.qlogic.com/support/os_detail.asp?seriesid=57&osid=26] QLogic. HP sells a

Khalid Aziz reports that there may be a problem with XP512 support of Linux
due to a hole in LUN numbers. If the LUNs were numbered continuously, you
would see all LUNs. Some folks in HP have written patches for this.
Essentially all that is needed is to add an entry in device_list[] in
scsi_scan.c for the XP512 and set the flag BLIST_SPARSELUN. The entry would
look something like:
{ "HP", "XP512", "*", BLIST_SPARSELUN}                                       
The first field is the vendor name as reported by XP512 and second field is
the model name as reported by XP512. These two need to match what XP512
returns in Inquiry command, exactly.

Chapter 4. Solutions and Sizing 

  This chapter proposes an help for sizing NetServers under Linux, depending
on the different kind of use. 

  You have to consider that exercise as a bit perilous. Indeed, only the
reality allows to test such previsions. Nevertheless, using the experience
acquired by deploying solutions in the past, we can give some useful rules. 

  We may apply a certain number of rules valid for the sizing of classical
Unix servers, considering that CISC systems (the majority in Linux
environment) need 2.5 less times resources in memory than RISC systems, due
to the fact that binaries used are smaller (Intel platforms are for the
moment 32 bits architectures). This has also influences on disk and swap
space. 

  It's obvious you have to consider, whatever the system, bottlenecks of the
solution put in place, because they will determine the weakest link in the
chain. 

  You have to look particularly at the following points : 

  *   The number and the speed of disks (the I/O rate of 10.000 rpm disks may
    go up to 20 MB/s, and 25 for 15.000 rpm disks),  
   
  *   The number and the speed of SCSI controlers (the I/O rate of Ultra2 LVD
    of the LC2000 - LH3/4/3000/6000 may go up to 80 MB/s, and latest B model
    up to 160 MB/s),  
   
  *   The addition of a supplementary SCSI card supported, when adding slow
    peripherals (DAT, DLT, CD writer ...) in order to avoid that the
    controler slow down in compatible mode, and that I/O performances drop
    significantly. 
   

  You have also to be suspicious of the extensible functions of machines.
Indeed, it's often better for a customer to add a new server, rather than to
increase the capacities of the one in place. The first reason is a financial
one, on one side, because the costs of add-ons on an already old system may
be near those of a new system, whose prices are becoming cheaper and cheaper.
And the same for maintenance. On the other hand, technically, it could be
more interesting to benefit from the latest technologies to obtain a machine
more equilibrate, powerful and to reuse the old one for secondary tasks
(secondary DNS, ...) or to split processes from the other one. For example,
when Ultra2 LVD was introduced, it was more interesting to buy a new server
to benefit from the 80 MB/s SCSI bus speed, rather than to update a server
which had 40 MB/s Ultra Wide SCSI. This implies that it's interesting to size
correctly the server, from the begining, for the whole forseeable period of
life of its use (typically 3 years nowadays). 

  In the same kind of ideas, you have to examine closely the choice between a
bi-processors and two mono-processors machines. 2 different systems imply 2
disk controlers, 2 disks set, 2 separate RAM busses thus better performances,
but more administration. On the other hand, a unique system renders it
easier, allows for a quicker communication between processors, which could be
necessary for certain applications, but makes the environment more fragile
(more downtime in case of an hardware problem). In fact, there are more
losses intrinsically on a multi-processor model, in communications at the
system level. This question should mainly be considered for the addition of a
processor (necesseraly obsolete) on a machine a posteriori, rather than to
add a new server. 

  On memory aspects, Linux can manage today up to 64 GB in stable kernels.
Linux takes the maximum from the memory you give to it, mainly by the
constitution of a cache disk which improves greatly system performances. You
may thus oversize the quantity of RAM installed, because it's preferable to a
situation where the server would be forced to swap (which drop performances
dramatically). The minimum RAM size provided on the NetServers (128 ou 256
MB) matches perfectly a normal use of a system, and doesn't need any
particular addition. You have to take in account that there is no graphical
environment used on production servers. Concerning the swap, under Linux, it
comes in addition to the RAM to give the complete virtual memory available
for the server. As a base rule, it's recommanded to give the same amount of
swap space as the amount of RAM, to allow the system to put on disk nearly
all the running processes in case of need. But the rule which exists for
System V Unix (such as HP-UX) consisting of reserving twice the amount of RAM
for swap isn't useful under Linux. You may note that Linux may swap certain
inactive processes to free the maximum RAM possible. So having a system whose
swap is partially used isn't necesseraly a proof of lack of memory, nor lack
of performances. 

  You'll find below recommandations depending of the type of use made by the
HP NetServer under Linux. It's possible to cumulate several functions on the
same server. You'll take care to add at least in that case the resources
needed to give the services. 

  Some generic rules have to be considered :

  *   We consider that the number of simultaneous users is the same as half
    the whole number of users on the server. 
   
  *   The minimal RAM size needed for a usable Linux server is 32 MB, which
    is less than the minimum amount of RAM available on the NetServers (128
    MB). In case you use X-Window with KDE or Gnome on this machine, you need
    to have 64 MB in supplement, thus 96 MB as a minimum. 
   
  *   The minimal disk size needed for a usable Linux server is 2 GB, which
    is less than the minimum amount of disk available on the NetServers (9
    GB). 
   
  *   In case of use of Raid 1, you have to double the amount of disk space
    useful to obtain the disk space needed. In case of use of Raid 5, you
    need to add 1 disk to obtain the disk space needed (up to 8 disks). 
   
  *   Except in particular cases (computing server), the amount of swap is
    the same as the amount of RAM. 
   
  *   The minimal processor needed for a usable Linux server is a Pentium
    133, which is less than the minimum processor available on the NetServers
    (Pentium III 933).
   
  *   Each X-Window user excuting a client on the server uses in average 2
    MB. 
   
  *   It may be useful to add network cards in this type of machine to smooth
    the traffic, depending on the number of clients. Using the bonding option
    provided by the Linux kernel may also be very useful.

4.1. Linux as file and print server

4.1.1. Linux as file server

  The sharing service uses 2 MB of RAM, and 2 more MB per share. In case of a
unique share (users space for example), it leads to a 2 MB consumption per
user. In the proposed case, we estimate that each user has 100 MB of disk
space on the server, with an evolution to 200 MB 3 years later. Processor
resources used are relativeley small, an entry level model will be sufficient
from that point of view. We will priviledge the I/O speed with Ultra 3 LVD
SCSI at 160 MB/s, if the budget allows it, and 15.000 RPM disks.

4.1.2. Linux as print server

  The sharing service uses 2 MB of RAM, and 2 more MB per printer shared. In
case of a unique share (One printer per user typically), it leads to a 2 MB
consumption per user. In the proposed case, we estimate that each user prints
simultaneously files of 5 MB in average, thus we need to have that space
available on the server. Processor resources used are relativeley small, an
entry level model will be sufficient from that point of view.

4.2. Internet/Intranet Linux server

4.2.1. Web Server

  The Web service uses 2.5 MB of RAM, in static mode (simple HTML pages) and
5 MB of RAM in dynamic mode (HTML pages generated from perl, PHP, ...) per
user. The disk space needed is function of the nature of the server, knowing
that most of the consumption comes from images. Processor resources used are
important, thus it could be useful to consider the increase in frequency and
the addition of processors, because this type of traffic could be quite well
done in parallel. With Apache 2.0 and the support of threads, it will become
even more obvious. We will priviledge also the I/O speed with Ultra 2 LVD
SCSI at 80 MB/s, if the budget allows it, and 10.000 RPM disks.

4.2.2. Mail Server

  Generally, this machine is used as both SMTP (sending and reception of
messages) and POP/IMAP server (keeper of messages and manager of client
accesses). The SMTP Mail service uses 2 MB of RAM per user. The POP/IMAP Mail
service uses 2 MB of RAM per user. The disk space needed becomes more and
more important as long as attachments (images, various documents) take the
greatest place in exchanges via e-mail. We consider in that case that an
average mail box size is 50 MB. Processor resources used are important, thus
it could be useful to consider the increase in frequency and the addition of
processors, because this type of traffic could be quite well done in
parallel.

4.2.3. Firewall/Proxy/Web-Cache server

  Generally, this machine is both a Firewall server, a proxy (in both
directions) and a cache for the Web because all requests go through it. The
Firewall service uses 1 MB of RAM. The Proxy service uses 0.3 MB per incoming
relay. The Web cache service uses 0.5 MB per user. The disk space needed is
function of the parameters of the cache Web server. In that case, we consider
20 MB per user. Processor resources used are important, due to the analysis
of IP packets. Thus it could be useful to consider the increase in frequency.

4.2.4. Directory server

  Generally, this machine use a software like [http://www.openldap.org]
OpenLDAP to fulfill its goals. The LDAP service uses 1 MB of RAM and 10 kB of
RAM per user. The disk space needed is of the same kind, so 10 kB per user.
Processor resources used are moderated.

4.3. Linux as computing server

  Generally, this machine is extremely stressed, mainly on the processor and
RAM aspects. Sometimes this is combined with intensive I/O needs. We thus
equip such a machine with high-end processors (nowadays Pentium III Xeon)
with the greatest level 2 cache possible (nowadays 2 MB). In RAM, we would
tend to reach the maximum possible, thus 4 GB. For this type of server, we
should adapt the swap such as it covers all the needs in memory required by
the computing codes to execute. There is often no specific constraint on
network performances, except in case of a computing cluster, in which case we
may consider to equip the machines with 100 Mb/s cards with a switch between
them, even with Myrinet, Dolphin or Gigabit products. Typically, a LP1000 2*
PIII 1.4GHz 1 GB/2*9GB is the target of this type of server. The choice is
extremely variable depending on the nature of the computation to do. We
should underline that there are processors, such as PA-Risc, much more
performant in floating point computation than today Intel processors (up to 6
times). The new IA-64 Itanium family seems also to bring a better compromise
for price/performances for that environment. 

  This is by the way not the only approach as shown by the i-cluster project.

more frequent in Microsoft world, by association with [http://www.citrix.com/
products/metaframe.asp] Metaframe solutions of [http://www.citrix.com/]
Citrix. An office server needs 50 MB of RAM per user. Intrinsically, this
machine has no requirements in term of disk, if it's not at the same time a
file server. Processor resources used are important, thus it could be useful
to consider the increase in frequency and the addition of processors, because
this type of traffic could be quite well done in parallel.

5.1. "What's new in kernel 2.2 ?"

Read [http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=1999-01-26-015-05-NW-SM]
Wonderful World of Linux 2.2 or [http://www.linux-france.org/article/sys/

5.2. "What's new in kernel 2.4 ?"

Read [http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2001-01-05-007-04-NW-LF-KN]
Wonderful World of Linux 2.4.

5.3. "How to have more than 1 GB of RAM on my NetServer ?"

The following information are adapted from the [http://humbolt.geo.uu.nl/
Linux-MM/more_than_1GB.shtml] page of Rik van Riel. They concern 2.0.x as
well as 2.2.x kernels, and 2.4.x. 

  First of all, the IA32 Intel architecture is limited by construction in its
memory management to 4 GB. Space which should be divided into virtual memory
and physical memory. Which means that if you choose to recognize more RAM,
the maximum size for a program decreases. 

  But Linux can't manage more than 1 GB by default. To go above that, in fact
up to 2 GB today, because Linux can't manage more memory for the moment, you
need to modify 2 files provided with kernel sources and recompile it. Those 2
sources are /usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386/page.h and /usr/src/linux/arch/
i386/vmlinux.lds.

  From 2.0.37 and 2.2.12 kernels on, the patch was integrated in the kernel
and may be activated when doing a make {menu,x}config.

  The maximum Ram managed in the i386 version was ported to 64 GB after
2.3.23. 

5.4. "How to have more than 128 MB of swap on my NetServer ?"

Up to the version 2.8x of the util-linux package, the mkswap command could
create swap partitions only up to 128 MB maximum. You then had to create as
much partitions as necessary. Till the 2.9 version, included in standard in
RedHat 6.0 and following distributions, it's possible to create directly swap
partitions up to 2 GB and to 8 partitions. 

5.5. "How to use the other procesors of my NetServer ?"

Multi-processing is supported by Linux operationnaly till the 2.0 version of
the kernel. For a 2.0.x kernel, you have to recompile it and set up the SMP
variable in the Makefile to 1. For a 2.2.x or 2.4.x kernel, you have to set
it up during the make {menu,x}config. For more details, please consult the
[http://www.irisa.fr/prive/mentre/smp-howto] SMP-HOWTO.

5.6. "Is Linux Y2K compatible ?"

Generally, Linux is Y2K compatible. For more information please consult the
[http://www.linux.org/help/beginner/year2000.html] FAQ.

5.7. "How to increase the number of processes managed by the kernel ?"

For 2.2.x kernels, you need to edit the file /usr/src/linux/include/linux/
tasks.h, modify the value of the constant NR_TASKS (512 by default) and set
it to a value which doesn't exceed 4092 or 4090 if APM is configured. It
could be useful to set MAX_TASKS_PER_USER at the same time to an appropriate
value. Then recompile the kernel as usual. 

5.8. "How to increase the number of loopback devices managed by the kernel ?"

You need to edit the file /usr/src/linux/drivers/block/loop.c, For 2.2.x
kernels, you need to modify the value of the constant MAXLOOP (8 by default).
For 2.4.x kernels, you need to modify the value of the static int max_loop
variable. Then recompile the kernel as usual. 

5.9. "How to have files bigger than 2 GB on ext2 ?"

You need to have a kernel 2.4.x, glibc 2.1.3 at least and that all necessary
tools have been recompiled. Look at [http://www.suse.de/~aj/linux_lfs.html]
