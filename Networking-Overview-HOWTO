  1.  Introduction


  The purpose of this document is to give an overview of the networking
  capabilities of the Linux operating system. Although one of the
  strengths of Linux is that plenty of information exists for nearly
  every component of it, most of this information is focused on
  implementation. New Linux users, particularly those coming from a
  Windows environment, are often unaware of the networking possibilities
  of Linux. This document aims to show a general picture of such
  possibilities with a brief description of each one and pointers for
  further information. The information has been gathered from many
  sources: HOWTOs, faqs, projects' web pages and my own hands-on
  experience. Full credit is given to the authors of these other
  sources. Without them and their programs this document would have not
  been possible or necessary.


  2.  Linux.


  2.1.  What is Linux?

  The primary author of Linux is Linus Torvalds. Since his original
  versions, it has been improved by countless numbers of people. It is a
  clone, written entirely from scratch, of the Unix operating system.
  One of the more interesting facts about Linux is that its development
  occurs simultaneously around the world.

  Linux has been copyrighted under the terms of the GNU General Public
  License (GPL). This is a license written by the Free Software
  Foundation (FSF) that is designed to prevent people from restricting
  the distribution of software. In brief, it says that although money
  can be charged for a copy, the person who received the copy can not be
  prevented from giving it away for free. It also means that the source
  code must be available. This is useful for programmers. Anybody can
  modify Linux and even distribute his/her modifications, provided that
  they keep the code under the same copyright.


  2.2.  What makes Linux different?

  Why work on Linux? Linux is generally cheaper (or at least no more
  expensive) than other operating systems and is frequently less
  problematic than many commercial systems. But what makes Linux
  different is not its price (after all, why would anyone want an OS -
  even a free one - if it is not good enough?) but its outstanding
  capabilities:


    Linux is a true 32-bit multitasking operating system, robust and
     capable enough to be used in organizations ranging from
     universities to large corporations.

    It runs on hardware ranging from low-end 386 boxes to massive
     ultra-parallel machines in research centres.
    Out-of-the-box versions are available for Intel, Sparc, and Alpha
     architectures, and experimental support exists for Power PC and
     embedded systems, among others such as SGI, Ultra Sparc, AP1000+,
     Strong ARM, and MIPS R3000/R4000.

    Finally, when it comes to networking, Linux is choice. Not only
     because networking is tightly integrated with the OS itself and a
     plethora of applications is freely available, but for the
     robustness under heavy loads that can only be achieved after years
     of debugging and testing in an Open Source project.


  3.  Networking protocols


  Linux supports many different networking protocols:


  3.1.  TCP/IP


  The Internet Protocol was originally developed two decades ago for the
  United States Department of Defense (DoD), mainly for the purpose of
  interconnecting different-brand computers. The TCP/IP suite of
  protocols allowed, through its layered structure, to insulate
  applications from networking hardware.

  Although it is based on a layered model, it is focused more on
  delivering interconnectivity than on rigidly adhering to functional
  layers. This is one of the reasons why TCP/IP has become the de facto
  standard internetworking protocol as opposed to OSI.

  TCP/IP networking has been present in Linux since its beginnings. It
  has been implemented from scratch. It is one of the most robust, fast
  and reliable implementations and is one of the key factors of the
  success of Linux.

  Related HOWTO: http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO.html


  3.2.  TCP/IP version 6


  IPv6, sometimes also referred to as IPng (IP Next Generation) is an
  upgrade to the IPv4 protocol in order to address many issues. These
  issues include: shortage of available IP addresses, lack of mechanisms
  to handle time-sensitive traffic, lack of network layer security, etc.

  The larger name space will be accompanied by an improved addressing
  scheme, which will have a great impact on routing performance.  A beta
  implementation exists for Linux, and a production version is expected
  for the 2.2.0 Linux kernel release.

    Linux IPv6 HOWTO:http://www.wcug.wwu.edu/ipv6/faq/


  3.3.  IPX/SPX

  IPX/SPX (Internet Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange) is a
  proprietary protocol stack developed by Novell and based on the Xerox
  Network Systems (XNS) protocol. IPX/SPX became prominent during the
  early 1980s as an integral part of Novell, Inc.'s NetWare. NetWare
  became the de facto standard network operating system (NOS) of first
  generation LANs. Novell complemented its NOS with a business-oriented
  application suite and client-side connection utilities.

  Linux has a very clean IPX/SPX implementation, allowing it to be
  configured as an:

    IPX router

    IPX bridge

    NCP client and/or NCP Server (for sharing files)

    Novell Print Client, Novell Print Server

     And to:

    Enable PPP/IPX, allowing a Linux box to act as a PPP server/client

    Perform IPX tunnelling through IP, allowing the connection of two
     IPX networks through an IP only link

  Additionally, Caldera <http://www.caldera.com> offers commercial
  support for Novell NetWare under Linux. Caldera provides a fully
  featured Novell NetWare client built on technology licensed from
  Novell Corporation. The client provides full client access to Novell
  3.x and 4.x fileservers and includes features such as NetWare
  Directory Service (NDS) and RSA encryption.


    IPX HOWTO: http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/IPX-HOWTO.html


  3.4.  AppleTalk Protocol Suite

  Appletalk is the name of Apple's internetworking stack. It allows a
  peer-to-peer network model which provides basic functionality such as
  file and printer sharing. Each machine can simultaneously act as a
  client and a server, and the software and hardware necessary are
  included with every Apple computer.

  Linux provides full Appletalk networking. Netatalk is a kernel-level
  implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite, originally for BSD-
  derived systems. It includes support for routing AppleTalk, serving
  Unix and AFS filesystems over AFP (AppleShare), serving Unix printers
  and accessing AppleTalk printers over PAP.

  See section 5.1 for more information.


  3.5.  WAN Networking: X.25, Frame-relay, etc...

  Several third parties provide T-1, T-3, X.25 and Frame Relay products
  for Linux. Generally special hardware is required for these types of
  connections. Vendors that provide the hardware also provide the
  drivers with protocol support.


    WAN resources for Linux:
     http://www.secretagent.com/networking/wan.html



  3.6.  ISDN

  The Linux kernel has built-in ISDN capabilies. Isdn4linux controls
  ISDN PC cards and can emulate a modem with the Hayes command set ("AT"
  commands). The possibilities range from simply using a terminal
  program to connections via HDLC (using included devices) to full
  connection to the Internet with PPP to audio applications.


    FAQ for isdn4linux: http://ww.isdn4linux.de/faq/



  3.7.  PPP, SLIP, PLIP

  The Linux kernel has built-in support for PPP (Point-to-Point-
  Protocol), SLIP (Serial Line IP) and PLIP (Parallel Line IP). PPP is
  the most popular way individual users access their ISPs (Internet
  Service Providers). PLIP allows the cheap connection of two machines.
  It uses a parallel port and a special cable, achieving speeds of
  10kBps to 20kBps.

    PPP/SLIP emulator <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/SLIP-PPP-
     Emulator.html>

    PLIP information can be found in The Network Administrator Guide
     <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/LDP/nag/nag.html>


  3.8.  Amateur Radio

  The Linux kernel has built-in support for amateur radio protocols.

  Especially interesting is the AX.25 support. The AX.25 protocol offers
  both connected and connectionless modes of operation, and is used
  either by itself for point-point links, or to carry other protocols
  such as TCP/IP and NetRom.

  It is similar to X.25 level 2 in structure, with some extensions to
  make it more useful in the amateur radio environment.

    Amateur radio on Linux web site <http://radio.linux.org.au/>


  3.9.  ATM

  ATM support for Linux is currently in pre-alpha stage. There is an
  experimental release, which supports raw ATM connections (PVCs and
  SVCs), IP over ATM, LAN emulation...


    Linux ATM-Linux home page <http://lrcwww.epfl.ch/linux-atm/>


  4.  Networking hardware supported

  Linux supports a great variety of networking hardware, including some
  obsolete equipment.

  Some interesting documents:

    Hardware HOWTO <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Hardware-
     HOWTO.html>

    Ethernet HOWTO <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Ethernet-
     HOWTO.html>



  5.  File Sharing and Printing

  The primary purpose of many PC based Local Area Networks is to provide
  file and printer sharing services to the users. Linux as a corporate
  file and print server turns out to be a great solution.


  5.1.  Apple environment

  As outlined in previous sections, Linux supports the Appletalk family
  of protocols. Linux netatalk allows Macintosh clients to see Linux
  Systems as another Macintosh on the network, share files and use
  printers connected to Linux servers.

  Netatalk faq and HOWTO:

    http://thehamptons.com/anders/netatalk/

    http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/netatalk/

    http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/netatalk/faq.html


  5.2.  Windows Environment

  Samba is a suite of applications that allow most Unices (and in
  particular Linux) to integrate into a Microsoft network both as a
  client and a server. Acting as a server it allows Windows 95, Windows
  for Workgroups, DOS and Windows NT clients to access Linux files and
  printing services. It can completely replace Windows NT for file and
  printing services, including the automatic downloading of printer
  drivers to clients. Acting as a client allows the Linux workstation to
  mount locally exported windows file shares.

  According to the SAMBA Meta-FAQ:



       "Many users report that compared to other SMB implementations Samba is more stable,
       faster, and compatible with more clients. Administrators of some large installations say
       that Samba is the only SMB server available which will scale to many tens of thousands
       of users without crashing"

    Printing HOWTO <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Printing-
     HOWTO.html>


  5.3.  Novell Environment

  As stated in previous sections, Linux can be configured to act as an
  NCP client or server, thus allowing file and printing services over a
  Novell network for both Novell and Unix clients.


    IPX HOWTO <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/IPX-HOWTO.html>



  5.4.  Unix Environment

  The preferred way to share files in a Unix networking environment is
  through NFS. NFS stands for Network File Sharing and it is a protocol
  originally developed by Sun Microsystems. It is a way to share files
  between machines as if they were local. A client "mounts" a filesystem
  "exported" by an NFS server. The mounted filesystem will appear to the
  client machine as if it was part of the local filesystem.

  It is possible to mount the root filesystem at startup time, thus
  allowing diskless clients to boot up and access all files from a
  server. In other words, it is possible to have a fully functional
  computer without a hard disk.

  Coda is a network filesystem (like NFS) that supports disconnected
  operation, persistant caching, among other goodies.  It's included in
  2.2.x kernels. Really handy for slow or unreliable networks and
  laptops.

  6.  Internet/Intranet

  Linux is a great platform to act as an Intranet / Internet server. The
  term Intranet refers to the application of Internet technologies
  inside an organisation mainly for the purpose of distributing and
  making available information inside the company. Internet and Intranet
  services offered by Linux include mail, news, WWW servers and many
  more that will be outlined in the next sections.


  6.1.  Mail


  6.1.1.  Mail servers

  Sendmail is the de facto standard mail server program (called an MTA,
  or Mail Transport Agent) for Unix platforms. It is robust, scalable,
  and properly configured and with the necessary hardware, can handle
  loads of thousands of users without blinking.  Alternative mail
  servers, such as smail and qmail, are also available.


    Sendmail web site <http://www.sendmail.org/>

    Smail faq <http://www.sbay.org/smail-faq.html>

    Qmail web site <http://www.qmail.org>

    http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/Mail-Queue.html


  6.1.2.  Remote access to mail

  In an organisation or ISP, users will likely access their mail
  remotely from their desktops. Several alternatives exist in Linux,
  including POP (Post Office Protocol) and IMAP (Internet Message Access
  Protocol) servers. The POP protocol is usually used to transfer
  messages from the server to the client. IMAP permits also manipulation
  of the messages in the server, remote creation and deletion of folders
  in the server, concurrent access to shared mail folders, etc.

  6.1.3.  Mail User Agents

  There are a number of MUA (Mail User Agents) in Linux, both graphical
  and text mode. The most widely used ones include: pine, elm, mutt and
  Netscape.

    http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/TkRat.html


  6.1.4.  Mailing list software

  There are many MLM (Mail List Management) programs available for Unix
  in general and for Linux in particular.


    A good comparison of existing MLMs may be found
     at:ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/news.answers/mail/list-admin/

    Listserv <http://www.lsoft.com/>

    Majordomo home page <http://www.greatcircle.com/majordomo/>


  6.1.5.  Fetchmail

  One userful mail-related utility is fetchmail. Fetchmail is a free,
  full-featured, robust, well-documented remote-mail retrieval and
  forwarding utility intended to be used over on-demand TCP/IP links
  (such as SLIP or PPP connections). It supports every remote-mail
  protocol now in use on the Internet. It can even support IPv6 and
  IPSEC.

  Fetchmail retrieves mail from remote mail servers and forwards it via
  SMTP, so it can then be be read by normal mail user agents such as
  mutt, elm or BSD Mail. It allows all the system MTA's filtering,
  forwarding, and aliasing facilities to work just as they would on
  normal mail.

  Fetchmail can be used as a POP/IMAP-to-SMTP gateway for an entire DNS
  domain, collecting mail from a single drop box on an ISP and SMTP-
  forwarding it based on header addresses.

  A small company may centralise its mail in a single mailbox, configure
  fetchmail to collect all outgoing mail, send it via a single mailbox
  at their ISP and retrieve all incoming mail from the same mailbox.


    Fetchmail home page <http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/fetchmail/>


  6.2.  Web Servers

  Most Linux distributions include Apache <http://www.apache.org>.
  Apache is the number one server on the internet according to
  http://www.netcraft.co.uk/survey/ . More than a half of all internet
  sites are running Apache or one of it derivatives. Apache's advantages
  include its modular design, stability and speed. Given the appropriate
  hardware and configuration it can support the highest loads: Yahoo,
  Altavista, GeoCities, and Hotmail are based on customized versions of
  this server.

  Optional support for SSL (which enables secure transactions) is also
  available at:

    http://www.apache-ssl.org/

    http://raven.covalent.net/

    http://www.c2.net/

  6.3.  Web Browsers

  A number of web browsers exist for the Linux platform. Netscape
  Navigator has been one of the choices from the very beginning and the
  upcoming Mozilla (http://www.mozilla.org) will have a Linux version.
  Another popular text based web browser is lynx. It is fast and handy
  when no graphical environment is available.

    http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/Public-Web-Browser.html



  6.4.  FTP Servers and clients

  FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. An FTP server allows clients to
  connect to it and retrieve (download) files. Many ftp servers and
  clients exist for Linux and are included with most distributions.
  There are text-based clients as well as GUI based ones. FTP related
  software (servers and clients) for Linux may be found at:
  http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/file-transfer/


  6.5.  News service

  Usenet (also known as news) is a big bulletin board system that covers
  all kinds of topics and it is organised hierarchically. A network of
  computers across the internet (Usenet) exchange articles through the
  NNTP protocol. Several implementations exist for Linux, either for
  heavily loaded sites or for small sites receiving only a few
  newsgroups.

    INN home page <http://www.isc.org/>

    Linux news related software
     <http://www.linuxlinks.com/Software/Internet/News/>


  6.6.  Domain Name System

  A DNS server has the job of translating names (readable by humans) to
  IP addresses. A DNS server does not know all the IP addresses in the
  world; rather, it is able to request other servers for the unknown
  addresses. The DNS server will either return the wanted IP address to
  the user or report that the name cannot be found in the tables.

  Name serving on Unix (and on the vast majority of the Internet) is
  done by a program called named.  This is a part of the bind package of
  The Internet Software Consortium.

    BIND <http://www.isc.org/>

    DNS HOWTO <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/DNS-HOWTO.html>


  6.7.  DHCP, bootp

  DHCP and bootp are protocols that allow a client machine to obtain
  network information (such as their IP number) from a server. Many
  organisations are starting to use it because it eases network
  administration, especially in large networks or networks which have
  lots of mobile users.

  Related documents:

    DHCP mini-HOWTO
     <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/DHCP/index.html>


  6.8.  NIS

  The Network Information Service (NIS) provides a simple network lookup
  service consisting of databases and processes. Its purpose is to
  provide information that has to be known throughout the network to all
  machines on the network. For example, it enables an administrator to
  allow users access to any machine in a network running NIS without a
  password entry existing on each machine; only the main database needs
  to be maintained.

  Related HOWTO:

    NIS HOWTO <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/NIS-HOWTO.html>


  6.9.  Authentication

  There are also various ways of authenticating users in mixed networks.

    For Linux/Windows NT:http://www.mindware.com.au/ftp/smb-NT-
     verify.1.1.tar.gz

    The PAM (pluggable authentication module) which is a flexible
     method of Unix authentication: PAM library
     <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/index.html>.

    Finally, LDAP in Linux
     <http://www.umich.edu/~dirsvcs/ldap/index.html>

  7.  Remote execution of applications

  One of the most amazing features of Unix (yet one of the most unknown
  to new users) is its great support for remote and distributed
  execution of applications.


  7.1.  Telnet

  Telnet is a program that allows a person to use a remote computer as
  if that person were actually at the remote site. Telnet is one of the
  most powerful tools for Unix, allowing for true remote administration.
  It is also an interesting program from the point of view of users,
  because it allows remote access to all their files and programs from
  anywhere in the Internet. Combined with an X server, there is no
  difference (apart from the delay) between being at the console or on
  the other side of the planet. Telnet daemons and clients are available
  with most Linux distributions.

  Encrypted remote shell sessions are available through SSH
  (http://www.ssh.fi/sshprotocols2/index.html
  <http://www.ssh.fi/sshprotocols2/index.html>) thus effectively
  allowing secure remote administration.


    Telnet related software
     <http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/telnet/>


  7.2.  Remote commands

  In Unix, and in particular in Linux, remote commands exist that allow
  for interaction with other computers from the shell prompt. Examples
  are: rlogin, which allows for login in a remote machine in a similar
  way to telnet, rcp, which allows for the remote transfer of files
  among machines, etc. Finally, the remote shell command rsh allows the
  execution of a command on a remote machine without actually logging
  onto that machine.


  7.3.  The X Window System

  The X Window System was developed at MIT in the late 1980s, rapidly
  becoming the industry standard windowing system for Unix graphics
  workstations. The software is freely available, very versatile, and is
  suitable for a wide range of hardware platforms. Any X environment
  consists of two distinct parts, the X server and one or more X
  clients. It is important to realise the distinction between the server
  and the client. The server controls the display directly and is
  responsible for all input/output via the keyboard, mouse or display.
  The clients, on the other hand, do not access the screen directly -
  they communicate with the server, which handles all input and output.
  It is the clients which do the "real" computing work - running
  applications or whatever. The clients communicate with the server,
  causing the server to open one or more windows to handle input and
  output for that client.

  In short, the X Window System allows a user to log in into a remote
  machine, execute a process (for example, open a web browser) and have
  the output displayed on his own machine. Because the process is
  actually being executed on the remote system, very little CPU power is
  needed in the local one. Indeed, computers exist whose primary purpose
  is to act as pure X servers.  Such systems are called X terminals.

  A free port of the X Window System exists for Linux and can be found
  at: Xfree <http://www.xfree86.org/>. It is included in most Linux
  distributions.

  Related HOWTO:

    Remote X Apps HOWTO <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/Remote-
     X-Apps.html>



  7.4.  VNC

  VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
  display system which allows one to view a computing 'desktop'
  environment not only on the machine where it is running, but from
  anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of machine
  architectures. Both clients and servers exist for Linux as well as for
  many other platforms. It is possible to execute MS-Word in a Windows
  NT or 95 machine and have the output displayed in a Linux machine. The
  opposite is also true; it is possible to execute an application in a
  Linux machine and have the output displayed in any other Linux or
  Windows machine. One of the available clients is a Java applet,
  allowing the remote display to be run inside a web browser. Another
  client is a port for Linux using the SVGAlib graphics library,

  8.  Network Interconnection

  Linux networking is rich in features. A Linux box can be configured so
  it can act as a router, bridge, etc... Some of the available options
  are described below.


  8.1.  Router

  The Linux kernel has built-in support for routing functions. A Linux
  box can act either as an IP or IPX router for a fraction of the cost
  of a commercial router. Recent kernels include special options for
  machines acting primarily as routers:

    Multicasting:  Allows the Linux machine to act as a router for IP
     packets that have several destination addresses. It is needed on
     the MBONE, a high bandwidth network on top of the Internet which
     carries audio and video broadcasts.

    IP policy routing:  Normally a router decides what to do with a
     received packet based solely on the packet's final destination
     address, but routing can also take into account the originating
     address and the network device from which the packet reached it.

  There are some related projects which include one aiming at building a
  complete, running Linux router on a floppy disk: Linux router project
  <http://www.linuxrouter.org>


  8.2.  Bridge

  The Linux kernel has built-in support for acting as an Ethernet
  bridge, which means that the different Ethernet segments it is
  connected to will appear as one Ethernet to the participants. Several
  bridges can work together to create even larger networks of Ethernets
  using the IEEE802.1 spanning tree algorithm. As this is a standard,
  Linux bridges will interoperate properly with other third party bridge
  products. Additional packages allow filtering based on IP, IPX or MAC
  addresses.

    Bridge <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/Bridge.html>


  8.3.  IP Masquerade

  IP Masquerade is a developing networking function in Linux. If a Linux
  host is connected to the Internet with IP Masquerade enabled, then
  computers connecting to it (either on the same LAN or connected with
  modems) can reach the Internet as well, even though they have no
  officially assigned IP addresses. This allows for reduction of costs,
  since many people may be able to access the Internet using a single
  modem connection as well as contributes to increased security (in some
  way the machine is acting as a firewall, since unofficially assigned
  addresses cannot be accessed outside of that network).

    http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO.html


  8.4.  IP Accounting

  This option of the Linux kernel keeps track of IP network traffic,
  performs packet logging and produces some statistics. A series of
  rules may be defined so when a packet matches a given pattern, some
  action is performed: a counter is increased, it is accepted/rejected,
  etc.


  8.5.  IP aliasing

  This feature of the Linux kernel provides the possibility of setting
  multiple network addresses on the same low-level network device driver
  (e.g two IP addresses in one Ethernet card). It is typically used for
  services that act differently based on the address they listen on
  (e.g. "multihosting" or "virtual domains" or "virtual hosting
  services".

    IP Aliasing HOWTO <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/IP-
     Alias.html>


  8.6.  Traffic Shaping

  The traffic shaper is a virtual network device that makes it possible
  to limit the rate of outgoing data flow over another network device.
  This is especially useful in scenarios such as ISPs, where it is
  desirable to control and enforce policies regarding how much bandwidth
  is used by each client. Another alternative (for web services only)
  may be certain Apache modules which restrict the number of IP
  connections by client or the bandwidth used.

    http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO-6.html#ss6.15

  8.7.  Firewall

  A firewall is a device that protects a private network from the public
  part (the internet as a whole). It is designed to control the flow of
  packets based on the source, destination, port and packet type
  information contained in each packet.

  Different firewall toolkits exist for Linux as well as built-in
  support in the kernel. Other firewalls are TIS and SOCKS. These
  firewall toolkits are very complete and combined with other tools
  allow blocking/redirection of all kinds of traffic and protocols.
  Different policies can be implemented via configuration files or GUI
  programs.

    SOCKS <http://www.socks.nec.com/socksfaq.html>

    Firewall HOWTO <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Firewall-
     HOWTO.html>


  8.8.  Port forwarding

  An increasing number of web sites are becoming interactive by having
  cgi-bins or Java applets that access some database or other service.
  Since this access may pose a security problem, the machine containing
  the database should not be directly connected to the Internet.

  Port Forwarding can provide an almost ideal solution to this access
  problem. On the firewall, IP packets that come in to a specific port
  number can be re-written and forwarded to the internal server
  providing the actual service. The reply packets from the internal
  server are re-written to make it appear that they came from the
  firewall.

  Port forwarding information may be found here
  <http://www.ox.compsoc.net/~steve/portforwarding.html>



  8.9.  Load Balancing

  Demand for load balancing usually arises in database/web access when
  many clients make simultaneous requests to a server. It would be
  desirable to have multiple identical servers and redirect requests to
  the less loaded server. This can be achieved through Network Address
  Translation techniques (NAT) of which IP masquerading is a subset.
  Network administrators can replace a single server providing Web
  services - or any other application - with a logical pool of servers
  sharing a common IP address. Incoming connections are directed to a
  particular server using one load-balancing algorithm. The virtual
  server rewrites incoming and outgoing packets to give clients the
  appearance that only one server exists.

  Linux IP-NAT information may be found  here <http://www.csn.tu-
  chemnitz.de/HyperNews/get/linux-ip-nat.html>


  8.10.  EQL

  EQL is integrated into the Linux kernel. If two serial connections
  exist to some other computer (this usually requires two modems and two
  telephone lines) and  SLIP or PPP (protocols for sending Internet
  traffic over telephone lines) are used on them, it is possible to make
  them behave like one double speed connection using this driver.
  Naturally, this has to be supported at the other end as well.


    http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO-6.html#ss6.2


  8.11.  Proxy Server

  The term proxy means "to do something on behalf of someone else." In
  networking terms, a proxy server computer can act on the behalf of
  several clients. An HTTP proxy is a machine that receives requests for
  web pages from another machine (Machine A). The proxy gets the page
  requested and returns the result to Machine A. The proxy may have a
  cache with the requested pages, so if another machine asks for the
  same page the copy in the cache will be returned instead. This allows
  efficient use of bandwidth resources and less response time. As a side
  effect, as client machines are not directly connected to the outside
  world this is a way of securing the internal network. A well-
  configured proxy can be as effective as a good firewall.

  Several proxy servers exist for Linux. One popular solution is the
  Apache proxy module. A more complete and robust implementation of an
  HTTP proxy is SQUID.


    Apache <http://www.apache.org>

    Squid <http://squid.nlanr.net/>



  8.12.  Diald on demand

  The purpose of dial on demand is to make it transparently appear that
  the users have a permanent connection to a remote site.  Usually,
  there is a daemon who monitors the traffic of packets and where an
  interesting packet (interesting is defined usually by a set of
  rules/priorities/permissions) arrives it establishes a connection with
  the remote end. When the channel is idle for a certain period of time,
  it drops the connection.

    Diald HOWTO <http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Diald-HOWTO.html>


  8.13.  Tunnelling, mobile IP and virtual private networks

  The Linux kernel allows the tunnelling (encapsulation) of protocols.
  It can do IPX tunnelling through IP, allowing the connection of two
  IPX networks through an IP only link. It can also do IP-IP tunnelling,
  which it is essential for mobile IP support, multicast support and
  amateur radio. (see
  http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO-6.html#ss6.8)

  Mobile IP specifies enhancements that allow transparent routing of IP
  datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet.  Each mobile node is always
  identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of
  attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a
  mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides
  information about its current point of attachment to the Internet.
  The protocol provides for registering the care-of address with a home
  agent.  The home agent sends datagrams destined for the mobile node
  through a tunnel to the care-of address.  After arriving at the end of
  the tunnel, each datagram is then delivered to the mobile node.

  Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a networking technology
  that allows the use of the Internet as a secure virtual private
  network (VPN). PPTP is integrated with the Remote Access Services
  (RAS) server which is built into Windows NT Server. With PPTP, users
  can dial into a local ISP, or connect directly to the Internet, and
  access their network as if they were at their desks. PPTP is a closed
  protocol and its security has recently being compromised. It is highly
  recomendable to use other Linux based alternatives, since they rely on
  open standards which have been carefully examined and tested.


    A client implementation of the PPTP for Linux is available  here
     <http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/~cananian/Projects/PPTP/>

  9.  Network Management


  9.1.  Network management applications

  There is an impressive number of tools focused on network management
  and remote administration.  Some interesting remote administration
  projects are linuxconf and webmin:

    Webmin <http://www.webmin.com/webmin/>


    Linuxconf <http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/linuxconf/>

  Other tools include network traffic analysis tools, network security
  tools, monitoring tools, configuration tools, etc. An archive of many
  of these tools may be found at Metalab
  <http://www.metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/>


  9.2.  SNMP

  The Simple Network Management Protocol is a protocol for Internet
  network management services. It allows for remote monitoring and
  configuration of routers, bridges, network cards, switches, etc...
  There is a large amount of libraries, clients, daemons and SNMP based
  monitoring programs available for Linux. A good page dealing with SNMP
  and Linux software may be found at : http://linas.org/linux/NMS.html


  10.  Enterprise Linux Networking

  In certain situations it is necessary for the networking
  infrastructure to have proper mechanisms to guarantee network
  availability nearly 100% of the time. Some related techniques are
  described in the following sections. Most of the following material
  can be found at the excellent Linas website:
  http://linas.org/linux/index.html and in the Linux High-Availability
  HOWTO <http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/ALPHA/linux-ha/High-
  Availability-HOWTO.html>


  10.1.  High Availability

  Redundancy is used to prevent the overall IT system from having single
  points of failure. A server with only one network card or a single
  SCSI disk has two single points of failure. The objective is to mask
  unplanned outages from users in a manner that lets users continue to
  work quickly. High availability software is a set of scripts and tools
  that automatically monitor and detect failures, taking the appropriate
  steps to restore normal operation and to notifying system
  administrators.


  10.2.  RAID

  RAID, short for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks, is a method
  whereby information is spread across several disks, using techniques
  such as disk striping (RAID Level 0) and disk mirroring (RAID level 1)
  to achieve redundancy, lower latency and/or higher bandwidth for
  reading and/or writing, and recoverability from hard-disk crashes.
  Over six different types of RAID configurations have been defined.
  There are three types of RAID solution options available to Linux
  users: software RAID, outboard DASD boxes, and RAID disk controllers.


    Software RAID: Pure software RAID implements the various RAID
     levels in the kernel disk (block device) code.

    Outboard DASD Solutions: DASD (Direct Access Storage Device) are
     separate boxes that come with their own power supply, provide a
     cabinet/chassis for holding the hard drives, and appear to Linux as
     just another SCSI device. In many ways, these offer the most robust
     RAID solution.

    RAID Disk Controllers: Disk Controllers are adapter cards that plug
     into the ISA/EISA/PCI bus. Just like regular disk controller cards,
     a cable attaches them to the disk drives. Unlike regular disk
     controllers, the RAID controllers will implement RAID on the card
     itself, performing all necessary operations to provide various RAID
     levels.

    http://linas.org/linux/raid.html


  10.3.  Redundant networking

  IP Address Takeover (IPAT). When a network adapter card fails, its IP
  address should be taken by a working network card in the same node or
  in another node. MAC Address Takeover: when an IP takeover occurs, it
  should be made sure that all the nodes in the network update their ARP
  caches (the mapping between IP and MAC addresses).
