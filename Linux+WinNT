  This mini-HOWTO covers some ways on how to install both Linux and Win-
  dows NT on the same computer and how to boot either of them from
  within LILO menu. There is also another mini-HOWTO "Linux+NT-Loader"
  that covers how to boot either of them from within NT Loader menu. As
  I consider Windows 2000 to be Windows NT version 5.0 this mini-HOWTO
  also covers upgrading from NT 4.0 to 2000.

  More detailed information about LILO (Linux Loader) itself you may
  find in wonderfull LILO <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO.html> mini-HOWTO.



  1.  Introduction

  Bill Wohler wrote in his v1.1 of The Linux+WindowsNT mini-HOWTO:

  "Due to hardware or software problems or user headroom, I pulled my
  hair out for several days trying to get both NT and Linux happily
  settled on my new HP Vectra PC at work."

  I could say that was true in my case too, but you really have a way to
  make both Linux and Windows NT co-existing on the same machine and to
  switch from one of them to another.


  "Under no circumstances run the Disk Administrator from NT 3.51 to
  format partitions.  It asks if it can write a signature "which will
  cause absolutely no harm."  When it did this, it hosed my partition
  table until fixed by steps 3 and 7 below.  Because of these problems,
  I was limited to one FAT NT partition.  Also remember that even if you
  do get the Disk Administrator to work, you'll want at least one small
  FAT partition to use as a staging area for exchanging files between
  Linux and NT until Linux has an NTFS filesystem."

  Well, NT's Disk Administrator is sufficient tool to check what
  situation on your hard disk(s) you have, before and after you used an
  utility called Partition Magic by Power Quest. This utility might be
  needed to 'shrink' your NT (either NTFS or FAT) partition, in order to
  get some free space for your further Linux' partitions.  (After a
  while, I recognized that 'shrinking' used partition might not be
  needed. Actually, if you start from 'scratch', it might be the best
  way to re-format your whole disk(s) using FDISK command. You should
  make a DOS boot floppy diskette where DOS commands FDISK and FORMAT
  have to be also copied.  More details later...)

  "I installed Linux first and then NT, but based on my experience, I
  might now be able to install NT first and then Linux."

  Of course you all are able to install Windows NT first and after that
  Linux. We'll see how to do that and how to use LILO (Linux Loader) to
  chose which operating system to boot. But, before that we'll see the
  procedure that Bill Wohler, the previous maintainer of this mini-
  HOWTO, has been using:



  2.  How to install: LINUX first , WINDOWS NT after

  1. Install a minimal Linux (hold off on installing the rest until you
  win the Linux/NT battle).  Do all your disk partitioning in Linux,
  including your NT partition (make it FAT).  I was not successful at
  making more than one NT partition.  I also made it the first
  partition, but I don't know if that is essential or not.



  2. Edit /etc/lilo.conf and use boot=/dev/sda (I was not successful at
  installing LILO on the Linux partition--/dev/sda3 in my case) and run
  "lilo".  You'll have to use the editor ae.  You'll live.


  3. Save the MBR with this: dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 count=1
  Use a floppy.  Trust me.  Also do this each time you change the disk
  partition table.


  4. Install NT, part 1.  When it goes to reboot halfway through the
  process you'll boot into Linux.



  5. Add NT stanza to /etc/lilo.conf, e.g.:


          other=/dev/sda1
          label=NT
          table=/dev/sda



  and run lilo.  If lilo complains about this (I forget the message),
  add the "linear" flag to /etc/lilo.conf near the "compact" keyword.
  Furthermore, if your partition table is screwed up by NT you'll either
  need to use "ignore-table" or follow the directions in Step 7.  See
  also "fix-table".  The LILO HOWTO is your friend.



  6. Reboot, select NT from LILO, and finish NT install.  You'll need
  the "Boot Disk XU, HP Vectra AIC 7880 Driver A.01.02" floppy to
  install the ethernet drivers and the "XU/VT Drivers and Documentation"
  CD (directory video/disk4 if I recall correctly) to install the video
  drivers for the Matrox MGA Millennium.



  7. Back to Linux, run fdisk and ensure you don't get "partition
  doesn't end on cylinder boundary" on your Linux partitions.  You'll
  still have this error on the NT partition though, but this seems to be
  OK.



  /dev/sda1            1        1      322   329301    6  DOS 16-bit >=32M



  Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary:


  phys=(321, 39, 9) should be (321, 63, 32)

  Cfdisk reports strangeness, but it seems OK:

                                            Unusable                      0.04*

   /dev/sda1                 Primary        DOS 16-bit >=32Mb           321.59*

                                            Unusable                      0.39*



  If you do get the cylinder boundary warning on your Linux partitions,
  it is sufficient to use cfdisk to do something innocuous like changing
  the boot sector.



  If, however, NT has really screwed you over and cfdisk can't even run,
  complaining that it cannot open /dev/sda, then you'll need to take
  more extreme action.  You'll need that MBR you saved previously.
  Clear and restore the MBR (but not the signature) with:



            dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1

            dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/dev/sda bs=510 count=1



  8.  Install the rest of Linux.  Easy, huh?

  If you prefer to have NT write the MBR instead of LILO, you may have
  to resort to the following to clear the MBR first:


  ·  dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=446 count=1 (in Linux) or perform a
     low-level format with the SCSI utilities.  I've heard that a low-
     level format of an IDE disk is fatal, so don't do it.



  ·  fdisk /mbr (you've obviously already created a DOS boot disk that
     contains fdisk).



  ·  delete NT partition and create it again in NT install.



  ·  continue with NT install.


  Epilogue: After first posting this message, I heard from several folks
  that they had no problems with NT's Disk Administrator, and were able
  to install either NT or Linux first without any problems.  Hopefully,
  you'll be in this camp, but if not, perhaps this campfire story will
  be of some use.


  Since the first edition of this mini-HOWTO, others have written
  similar documents as well.  Please be sure to consult them.  If your
  experience differs from any presented, then you should submit your own
  mini-HOWTO or submit a revised version of this document to the HOWTO
  maintainer (reference this sentence) and send a carbon copy to me as I
  don't have the time to maintain this document.  Someone should
  eventually combine all of these documents into a single coherent
  HOWTO.


  Finally, I'm afraid this document details all I know about this
  subject.  I should point you to an appropriate Linux newsgroup for
  further information.  I use NT about one day a year.  Under duress.



  3.  How to install: WINDOWS NT first , LINUX after


  3.1.  If you have only one  IDE hard disk


  ·  First of all, I would suggest you to install a fresh copy of
     Windows NT 4.0 on your hard disk. I suppose that you already made a
     backup of your important data, so the NT installation shouldn't be
     a problem. During the NT installation, setup is not going to ask
     you where to place NT's boot loader, so it would be placed into the
     MBR (Master Boot Record) of your hard disk. But, there is a
     possibility for a previous content of the MBR to remain within the
     MBR (especially any previous Lilo), so I would suggest you (before
     installation of NT) to boot the computer with a DOS floppy diskette
     having DOS version of FDISK. At the prompt a:\  just enter the
     command: fdisk /mbr and restart the computer again (without that
     floppy).



  ·  After you have successfully installed your NT, you will see that it
     uses the whole hard disk or a specific partition of the hard disk
     (depending on what you decided during the setup process).  So, it
     is advisable to 'shrink' the partition where NT resides in order to
     make some free space on the disk. Onto that free space you will
     install your Linux. After you have your NT configured and running,
     you have to boot your computer using a floppy diskette with
     Partition Magic utility by Power Quest. It is a graphical tool able
     to see all partitions on all hard disks you have. The best thing is
     that you can make some changes with your partitions but not to
     destroy your existing data. One of the available changes is to make
     your existing partition(s) smaller, so to get some free space on
     the disk(s) for other purposes.  Although you are advised to make a
     backup before you make any changes to the partitions, I usually
     practice to 'shrink' NT's partition(s) before I install anything
     else onto this NT (so, if needed, a repetitive NT re-installation
     wouldn't be a problem).  Well, Partition Magic (or any other
     similar utility you are familiar with) will shrink your NT's
     partition (either NTFS or FAT) to a smaller measure and place it to
     either the beginning or to the end of the previous measure. It
     means that you may choose to have your 'shrinked' NT partition at
     the beginning or at the end of your disk (I usually choose NT to be
     at the beginning, so the ending part of the disk will become a
     'free space'). After the 'shrinking' is finished, you may re-boot
     your NT in order to check the new situation: you may use Windows
     Explorer or Disk Administrator for that.



  ·  As it was said in Introduction, it might not be needed always to
     use such tools like Partition Magic. It is better to say that this
     tool is of a great value in all those cases you have been running
     Windows NT for a long time, so you don't want to start from
     'scratch'. For example, you are fully satisfied with your beloved
     NT and related applications. You are not likely to kill NT, but you
     have recognized that you have enough unused space on NT's
     partition(s) (i.e. NT's partition(s) might look not much
     populated). That case, Partition Magic is your choice.

     But, if you do start from the beginning, or you don't mind re-
     formatting the disk, it might be suitable to get a blank floppy
     diskette, make it to be DOS bootable and copy two DOS tools on it:
     FDISK and FORMAT. So, restart your computer with such floppy and at
     A:\ prompt enter fdisk.  There you'll find several options that
     allow re-partition of your hard disk(s). Now you could make a part
     of the disk a FAT partition (where you'll later install your
     beloved NT). The rest of space you'd better leave alone (i.e. do
     not attempt making Linux partition(s) right now, using DOS's
     version of FDISK). If you really want to make Linux-type partitions
     now, you should look after Linux version of FDISK.



  ·  So far so good. Next step is to install your Linux. Case you are
     familiar with RedHat distribution (I hope with other distros is the
     same or similar), you start by putting your installation CD in the
     drive and re-boot the computer). Well, when you are about to choose
     what type of installation it will be (Gnome or KDE Workstation,
     Custom, etc.) you may choose whatever you planned before, but I
     would suggest to install a Workstation at first.  This is good
     because Linux setup will find automatically the free space on the
     (first) hard disk, make all partitions needed for Linux, format
     them properly, make majority of options by default so you won't
     have much pain during the setup (later, if you want, you may either
     add missing components or re-install RedHat Linux as Custom over
     the existing linux partitions). Lilo should go to the MBR.



  ·  Don't forget to make Linux boot floppy diskette. You'll never know
     when you may need it. If something goes wrong with the MBR, and you
     don't have boot floppy, your Linux might become not accessible, so
     you might have to re-install it again.



  ·  After it looks that Linux installation is finished, you are going
     to re-start the computer and there you will only see Lilo with only
     one entry to boot: Linux (or maybe more than one Linux entry, in
     case your hardware is multi-processor one or so). But, don't panic!
     Your Windows NT is still there - where you had installed it before
     Linux. You should become some familiar with Linux as soon as
     possible, in order to be able to find and edit your new
     /etc/lilo.conf file. When you open this file for the first time,
     you'll see that there is only one (or more) Linux entry. Well, you
     should know the exact position (read: a partition) where Windows NT
     has been installed, so you could add an appropriate entry into
     /etc/lilo.conf file. After you make those changes, restart Lilo
     with a command: /sbin/lilo and, after the next re-boot, you will
     have both 'linux' and 'nt' (or 'dos' or similar) entries under Lilo
     menu.



  ·  My added NT entry is:



           other=/dev/hda1
           label=nt

  So, the whole /etc/lilo.conf looks like this:



        boot=/dev/hda
        timeout=50
        prompt
            default=linux
            vga=normal
            read-only
        image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.12-20
            label=linux
            root=/dev/hda3
        other=/dev/hda1
            label=nt



  ·  Some more explanations regarding details from my /etc/lilo.conf
     file: After I have installed Windows NT, I assigned the letter C:
     to that drive. Beside that, I wanted to have another NTFS partition
     in order to store and backup important files, case I have to re-
     install NT on C: for some reason in the future. That's why I've
     made another NT partition, that has been assigned as D: disk.  Both
     NTFS partitions are approximatelly 3 GB each and Linux setup found
     them as /dev/hda1 and /dev/hda2 partitions. The rest free space on
     the disk was cca. 2 GB, where I have made the /root partition of
     near 1.9 GB and /swap part of cca. 100 MB (/dev/hda3 and /dev/hda4
     respectively). Lilo went to the MBR and all has been running fine.


     For your information, I wanted to make these linux partitions that
     time. Later, I found that it was not needed, so now I let Linux
     setup to make partitions from the free space in a way it likes to
     do that. I trust it :-)



  3.2.  If you have more than one  (SCSI) hard disk

  Notice: Folks, you see, at my place, one of computers has several SCSI
  disks. That's why I put the word 'SCSI' in parentheses. There I have a
  couple of SCSI controllers, a SCSI CD ROM drive and a SCSI Tape drive.
  That doesn't mean that *you* will be using SCSI parts at all.  You'd
  rather handle more than one IDE disks, but I hope that install process
  shouldn't change too much, if any.



  ·  First of all, I would suggest you to install a fresh copy of
     Windows NT 4.0 on your first hard disk. I suppose that you already
     made a backup of your important data, so the NT installation
     shouldn't be a problem. You can easily copy your data on your
     second hard disk or so. During the NT installation, setup is not
     going to ask you where to place NT's boot loader, so it would be
     placed into the MBR (Master Boot Record) of your first hard disk.
     But, there is a possibility for a previous content of the MBR to
     remain within the MBR (especially any previous Lilo), so I would
     suggest you (before installation of NT) to boot the computer with a
     DOS floppy diskette having DOS version of FDISK. At the prompt a:\
     just enter the command: fdisk /mbr and restart the computer again
     (without that floppy). If you want to be sure about your machine is
     'clean', you may also delete any existing partition(s) on your
     other disks, during the Windows NT Setup in case you have *not*
     made any backup on other disks.



  ·  After you have successfully installed your NT, you will see that it
     uses the whole hard disk or a specific partition of the hard disk
     (depending on what you decided during the setup process).  So, it
     is advisable to 'shrink' the partition where NT resides in order to
     make some free space on the disk. Onto that free space you will
     install your Linux. Well, you may also think of using other disk(s)
     you have for Linux (so did I). That case, you would start your
     linux installation and tried to use, for example, /dev/sdb (or sdc,
     or sdd, or else in case of SCSI system) or /dev/hdb (or hdc, or
     hdd, or else in case of IDE system). Looked that Linux installation
     accepted whatever I chose, but somehow after all was finished, when
     I did that, LILO was not able to do anything. Actually, it always
     stopped after 'LI' so it was not possible to start Linux at all.
     Finally, after pulling my hair out, I decided to make it all on the
     first disk. So, after I had NT configured and running, I had to
     boot my computer using a floppy diskette with Partition Magic
     utility by Power Quest.  It is a graphical tool able to see all
     partitions on all hard disks you have. The best thing is that you
     can make some changes with your partitions but not to destroy your
     existing data. One of the available changes is to make your
     existing partition(s) smaller, so you can get some free space on
     the disk(s) for other purposes.  Although you are advised to make a
     backup before you make any changes with your partitions, I usually
     practice to 'shrink' NT's partition before I install anything but
     NT itself (so, if needed, a repetitive re-installation wouldn't be
     a problem).  Well, Partition Magic (or any other similar utility
     you are familiar with) will shrink your NT's partition (either NTFS
     or FAT) to a smaller measure and place it to either the beginning
     or to the end of the previous measure. It means that you may choose
     to have your 'shrinked' NT partition at the beginning or at the end
     of your disk. I usually choose NT to be at the beginning, so the
     ending part of the disk will become a 'free space'. I discovered
     some problems if the 'free space' is made at the beginning of disk
     (later we'll talk about). So, after the NT in order to check the
     new situation: you may use Windows Explorer or Disk Administrator
     for that. You will also note how NT can 'see' all (other) disks you
     have in your machine (either partitioned or as 'free space' areas).



  ·  Once again, as it was said earlier, it might not be needed always
     to use such tools like Partition Magic. It is better to say that
     this tool is of a great value in all those cases you have been
     running Windows NT for a long time, so you don't want to start from

            root=/dev/sda6
        other=/dev/hda1
            label=nt


  ·  Some more explanation, regarding details from my /etc/lilo.conf
     file: After I have installed Windows NT on the first disk, I
     assigned the letter C: to that drive. After I made enough free
     space after the NTFS partition, I let Linux setup to handle further
     partitioning. Although Linux should support as far as four primary
     partitions per disk, it seems that Linux setup is likely to make an
     extended partition, whenever it recognizes that there is already a
     primary partition on the disk. Considering that those 'virtual'
     primary partitions would be numbered from /dev/sda1 to /dev/sda4
     (including an extended one, of course), the extended one should
     become /dev/sda4. Following that idea, the first one logical
     partition within the extended one was numbered as /dev/sda5 (in my
     case, it was the /boot partition that physically was the first from
     the beginning of the first hard disk). So, the /root and /swap
     partitions are /dev/sda6 and /dev/sda7 respectively. You may see a
     line "root=/dev/sda6" telling you that. Once again, Lilo went to
     the MBR and all has been running fine.



  ·  Well, you may ask me: OK, but what in a case I have several hard
     disks installed in the machine? Good question. You see, I myself
     have four SCSI disks and, of course, I tried to install Linux on
     the 2nd one, next the 3rd and, finally, on the 4th disk. Whatever I
     did (Linux setup haven't complained at all), when I was about to
     finish the installation and after performing the final automatic
     re-boot, my Lilo would stop after 'LI' so the computer had to be
     re-started. Finally, I realized that there must be a problem with
     disks that are too "far" from the MBR that is located at the
     beginning of the first hard disk. That's why I suggest you to make
     them all (both NT and Linux) on your first disk. After having all
     of them running OK, there is no problem to make other disks visible
     (and usable) by both operating system. I hope your first disk is
     large enough to carry both operating systems (NT needs at least
     cca. 150 MB for itself, Linux depends on what you want to get:
     Gnome or KDE Workstations are about 580 MB, but the Custom wants
     more than 1.4 GB). That means the first hard disk of cca. 2.4 GB
     should fit.



  ·  You may also ask me: OK, but, could I 'shrink' my NT partition in a
     way the 'free space' is made at the beginning of the disk? Well, I
     remember I tried to do so and to install, at first, Gnome
     Workstation (395 packages, 570 MB) there. During the setup,
     everything looked fine, but neither Lilo was not installed, nor the
     boot floppy was made. You bet, Linux was not functional. Then I
     tried to install KDE Workstation (377 packages, 582 MB) on the same
     place. Once again, everything looked fine, but neither Lilo was not
     installed, nor the boot floppy was made. Investigating that, I
     studied the structure of all existing partitions. I was surprised
     when recognized that new born logical partitions (within the new
     born extended one) were numbered as if they were physically
     positioned after the NT partition! In the other words, there I have
     got a 'funny' order: /dev/sda5, /dev/sda6, /dev/sda7 and, finally,
     /dev/sda1. Looked like the system was a bit confused. So I
     considered that it is advisable to make the 'free space' after
     already existing NT partition(s).



  ·  Regarding two similar Linux images (differ in 'smp'). It is a
     server hardware with a multi-processor support. The "intelligent"
     setup has inspected the hardware and offered me to have both
     'multi' and 'uni' processor functionality. Nevertheless, I still
     have only one CPU there.
  4.  How to upgrade  WINDOWS NT to WINDOWS 2000

  Well, actually, it isn't a real "upgrade" of running NT to 2000, but a
  "fresh" installation of Windows 2000 Professional.  I hope it should
  also work for other Windows 2000 products. I haven't tried its server-
  type installations yet, but I remember I haven't experienced any
  problem with NT, regarding it was Server or Workstation.



  ·  First of all, a backup of important data should be made! I do it by
     having another Windows-like partition on the disk, where I
     copy/move my texts, drawings etc. That partition is not going to be
     handled during the installation. After the backup is made, it's the
     right time to install Windows 2000.



  ·  You see, folks, whenever I (re)install a Windows NT product, I like
     to see it on a clean partition. It means, I remove i.e.  delete the
     existing partition where NT "system" files were stored, in order to
     get free ('unused') space. Then I chose to make a new partition
     that will be formatted as NTFS type of file system. After that, I
     opt to install Win2000 onto the new partition.



  ·  The procedure of Windows 2000 Setup will remove LILO from the MBR,
     so a couple of next re-bootings during the installation won't show
     LILO prompt.



  ·  When the Win2000 installation is finished, you may re-install your
     favorite applications and restore your data from the backup. You
     should then check if everything goes fine with your new and old
     Windoze stuff :-)



  ·  So far - so good. Now you have to look after your Linux boot floppy
     diskette. If you can't find it, you are out of luck.  Actually, I
     am not sure if all Linux systems might be now activated without
     boot diskette. Some Linux gurus suggest to boot Linux from the
     installation CD, but I don't know if it can help in case your
     system doesn't have bootable CD-ROM drive, i.e. a modern
     motherboard's BIOS. Any comment here?



  ·  Well, after you successfully boot your Linux, you should go to
     /etc/lilo.conf to check it once again. You should have there at
     least two options: Linux and NT. Case you don't see the option to
     boot your beloved Windoze, you have to add it. It was described in
     previous sections. Then you have to run /sbin/lilo in order to put
     LILO boot loader into the MBR.



  ·  That's all. Next time you boot your computer, you'll get your LILO
     prompt. Using <Tab> key you'll see your boot options.



  ·  From my experience - all work great! Although I removed previous
     WinNT installation in order to make new Win2000 installation and
     also lost (temporarily) LILO boot loader, at the end I got both of
     them, Win2000 and Linux, the same way as I did with WinNT and
     Linux!



  5.  How to install WINDOWS 2000 besides  LINUX and WINDOWS 98

  Notice: When I say 'beside Linux and Windows 98', I mean of Linux and
  Windows 98 that already work together, so they were installed earlier,
  before we made a decision to add Windows 2000. One of the machines I
  use at work, has both Linux and Win98. They both load from under LILO
  menu.


  Actually, it is not a  very big problem to install Windows 2000 on a
  computer where another Windows is running. In my case, it is Windows
  98 so I just put 2000's CD into the drive. After it recognized that an
  either to upgrade it to 2000 or to install W2k as the 'clean'
  installation. At first, I tried to upgrade my Windows 98 to W2k, in
  order to get a very similar combination that I have at home (described
  in previous chapter). But, some hardware and software compatibility
  issues were reported (I mean, some of my components wouldn't stay
  fully operational if I just did an upgrade).


  When saw that, I considered to try the 'fresh' installation of W2k,
  beside Win98 and Linux. Happily, I recently installed another HD into
  the box, so I did not need to handle the first disk, where Win98 and
  Linux were living. Actually, the main reason to add the second disk
  was that the first one got almost full. If I wanted to install the
  third operating system on the first disk, I'd have to clean it well.
  So, when W2k's Setup asked for the location to be installed, I told it
  to use the second disk, repartition it and format it as the NTFS file
  system (just to mention that my Win98 was FAT32 and Linux was ext2).


  After an hour or so, W2k's installation was finished. During the setup
  procedure, it re-started the system a couple of times. When it was
  about to do that for the first time, I was curious if it would re-
  write the MBR, where LILO resides (actually, in the previous chapter,
  I have mentioned that W2k's installation was likely to re-write the
  MBR).  Interestingly, it did not do that this time, so I continued to
  see the Windows 2000 boot loader, that in turn offered not only to
  load W2k but a 'Windows' (ie. my old Win98) too.


  Well, depending on which operating system I like to start, the
  procedure might slightly differ, but it is easy. No problem at all.
  For example:



  ·  If I like to load my Linux, then LILO boot is the "cross-road".  At
     this point, the 'linux' entry should either be chosen or set as
     default in /etc/lilo.conf;

  ·  If I like to load Windows, then the other entry under LILO boot
     should either be chosen or set to be default. After it is done,
     Windows 2000 boot loader should appear on the screen. On that
     point, I have two choices: W2k and W98. The rest is easy, both
     Windozes start from there happily.



  6.  How to install WINDOWS NT/2000 and LINUX (RedHat 7.1) on a laptop


  6.1.  If you want to have *both* NT and 2000, besides Linux

  Notice: Recently my bosses decided to get a couple of HP Omnibook 6000
  portables, so I quickly rushed to play with new toys. It was a series
  with Pentium 3 at 1 GHz and 128 MB of RAM. There's also a hard disk of
  30 GB, removable DVD and FDD drives, a secondary battery that goes to
  the removable drive bay (when it's empty) and NIC/modem combo card.



  ·  Well, the notebooks have come with Windows 2000 Professional
     preinstalled and I thought it might be great to reformat the disk
     and start from scratch. I think I did it again with Partition Magic
     utility by Power Quest. Actually, I have *erased* all existing
     partitions because I noticed a small one at the beginning of the
     disk, that looked to me a bit strange (well, I learned later that
     it was there for hibernation and/or diagnostics).



  ·  After that, I tried to repeat a procedure that I have always been
     very fond of: to make a couple of FAT partitions (cca. 2037 MB)
     where my NT and/or W2k would go. Don't ask me why I use that old
     FAT format - it is just to be sure that any type of Windows setup
     will recognize such a partition and, as well, to be sure that some
     file exchange (if needed) would be possible between various
     operating systems. Beside these FAT partitions (that start, of
     course, from the beginning of the disk), I have also made several
     FAT partitions but, this time, starting from the *end* of the disk.
     Partition Magic allowes a user to do that (<-- here the guys from
     Power Quest should send me a couple of 0.01$ for this commercial of
     their product :-)).


     Well, you may ask me why somebody should make a free space
     somewhere in between. The answer is: In order to allow Linux's
     /boot partition to stay under well known 1024 cylinder limitation.
     When it comes to 1024 cyl area (actually, when you enter 1025, 1026
     ... etc), it doesn't matter what is happening there. It means,
     there you may put your Linux / (root) partition (regardless of its
     size and structure), as well as to use remaining space for
     Windows/Linux exchange zone (i.e. FAT).



  ·  So far - so good. So, I put NT's installation disk and followed the
     procedure (you should be aware to use a "retail" NT installation
     disk, *not* the one that came with Omnibook 6000, because it is
     supposed to "restore" an NT installation, accompanied with a
     hibernation partition. Why such a partition seems not to be
     suitable here, we'll see later.



  ·  After Windows NT was installed completely, it was the right time to
     insert Windows 2000 installation CD (once again, do not use 2000's
     disks that have come with the computer). So, from within NT
     running, I have installed 2000 onto the next partition (actually,
     only the first part of the installation process starts from under
     NT, but it is OK). When the process has finished, you have two
     Windozes - on your first two partitions.


  ·  Everything seems to be running OK, excepting the diagnostics.  It
     should be activated with F10 at system boot if "restore" CD's were
     used. BTW, NT's "restoration" finishes with even bigger partition
     (cca. 500 MB). And not only that: this partition seems to be a
     *primary* one. That means, you may end up with a shortage of
     primary partitions, in case you intend to install several operating
     systems. Anyway, I have decided that the diagnostics is not too
     much important to me, so there's no use of F10 at system boot
     anymore :-)



  ·  Not to forget to say, the Windows 2000's boot loader should offer
     *both* NT and 2000 boot options, if you have followed the mentioned
     procedure (case you don't want to have *both* NT and W2k on the
     system, you may skip to the next section).



  ·  Well, that is the time when I usually look after a Linux
     installation CD's. The first one (in case of two) should be
     inserted into the DVD (or in a CD drive) and the system has to be
     re-booted.  As usual, after a second or two after switching the
     system on, Escape should be pressed one or two times, in order to
     change the "boot" device order (of course, a CD/DVD should be
     chosen here).



  ·  The rest of Linux installation is just as usual. Don't forget to
     make a Linux boot floppy at the end of the process (you never know
     when the boot floppy might be of help).



  ·  Folks, in short, that was that. If everything goes fine, the next
     system boot should take you into the Linux environment. Don't be
     surprised when you don't see your beloved Windoze(s) boot loader(s)
     anymore. You just have to look into the another great Linux
     document, called LILO <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO.html> mini-HOWTO.
     There you'll find more detailed information about how LILO (Linux
     Loader) works.



  ·  If you find it easier, read some pages before and check how it was
     accomplished in the chapter "HOW TO UPGRADE WINDOWS NT TO WINDOWS
     2000"



  6.2.  If you want to have only Windows 2000 and Linux

  Notice: Well, all I have said in the previous section, resulted in a
  "multiboot" (or, better to say, "3-boot") system. When I want to run
  Linux - I have to choose its option from within LILO menu.  When I am
  about to run any kind of Windoze - I have to choose Windows (or DOS,
  or whatever else) from within LILO menu. Soon after, on the screen
  appears Windows 2000 boot loader. Finally, from this point, either NT
  or 2000 may be booted. Well, for a next task, I wanted to install
  Symantec's Norton System Works onto both Microsoft environments.  I
  did it successfully, but it seems that I have later entered a command
  that resulted in changing something very important in the setup. In
  sum, I have become not able to run both flavors of Windows properly.
  Looks that it was the right time to re-install all the stuff again :-)

  ·  Folks, this time I decided to use one of those "restore" CD's, that
     came with the notebook. I must admit that I liked to see, as the
     background, a great blue logo "HP Invent", as well as "Manufactured
     by Hewlett Packard" in My Computer's Properties (<-- here the guys
     from HP should send me a couple of 0.01$ for this commercial :-))



  ·  Using the "restore" CD's might help you to avoid the whole long
     NT/2000's setup procedure(s), because they replicate or, if you
     like to say, "clone" images from the CD's to the hard disk, and it
     is very fast. In addition, the hibernation/diagnostics partition is
     being made by default. Finally, a couple of HP utils and tools can
     only be "restored" from these CD's.



  ·  So, after a 6-7 minutes, NT (or W2k) is in its place, ready to
     work. Similarly to "retail" versions (mentioned in the previous
     section), now it is the right time to boot the system with a Linux
     installation CD.



  ·  The rest of Linux installation is just as usual. Don't forget to
     make a Linux boot floppy at the end of the process (you never know
     when that boot floppy might be useful).



  ·  Folks, that was that - in short. If everything is fine, the next
     system boot should take you into the Linux environment. Don't be
     surprised when you don't see your beloved Windoze(s) boot loader(s)
     anymore. You just have to look into the another great Linux
     document, called LILO <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO.html> mini-HOWTO.
     There you'll find more detailed information about how LILO (Linux
     Loader) works.



  ·  If you find it easier, read some pages before and see how it was
     done in the chapter "HOW TO UPGRADE WINDOWS NT TO WINDOWS 2000"



  ·  You bet, the life would be much easier if there were not such
     troubles, like a "tolerance" between Windows and Linux world. Maybe
     I have made an another mistake somewhere in the cyberspace, but, as
     soon as I have finished with that Linux installation - RedHat 7.1
     in particular (today is May 04, 2002 and I still have no newer and
     better distros here. Any donation from the readership ...?), I
     recognized that F10 at the system boot, does not open the HP
     diagnostics anymore.  Actually, regardless of pressing F10, my
     Omnibook 6000 goes directly to the graphical LILO screen. *Before*
     installing Linux, diagnostics was running here without any problem.



  ·  FYI, after the first next boot into W2k, its Disk Management tool
     has recognized the following partitions on the disk:



         Size     Format        Label             Type
  1     15 MB      FAT          -                 Primary
  2    7.30 GB    FAT32         HPNOTEBOOK C:     Primary
  3     52 MB      -            -                 Primary
  4    18.37 GB    -            -                 Logical
  5     258 MB     -            -                 Logical
  6    1.96 GB    Free space    -                 -

  ·  On the other hand, Partition Magic "sees" as follows:



        Size in MB   Format        Label            Type
  1       14.7        FAT          save to disk     Primary
  2     7.471,4      FAT32         HPNOTEBOOK       Primary
  3       51.7        ext2         /boot            Primary
  4     21.077,9     extended      -                Primary
  5     18.811,4     ext2          /                Logical
  6       258,4      swap          -                Logical
  7     2.008,1      free space    -                Logical



  ·  Some more explanations, related to the tables above: It is obvious
     that diagnostics partition, accompanied with "restored" Windows
     2000, is rather small - cca. 15 MB (comparing to the partition,
     that is created with "restored" Windows NT, which goes up to cca.
     500 MB). Regardless of that fact, it is a primary one. That means
     you should be aware of how many primary partitions you have in the
     system. I am not sure now, but that might be one of the reasons for
     not having diagnostic tools available anymore, after completing all
     operating system installations.


     Next, you may see that I have "shrinked" W2k's FAT32 partition to a
     smaller size (cca. 7.5 gig), in order to release enough free space
     for Linux.


     I would suggest you to let Linux setup procedure to transform the
     free space into Linux partitions. I mean, there's no need to
     prepare the Linux partitions manually. As you can see from the
     tables, it took cca. 50 megs for the boot part, cca. twice a
     physical RAM (2 x 128 = 256 megs) for swap and the rest goes for
     other Linux parts.  Remaining free space was probably left after
     the conversions of various file format systems.



  ·  What is the result now: Linux works, Windows works too.  There's no
     diagnostics anymore. The hibernation (from under Windows) is not
     tested yet. At the first sight, the 3Com NIC/modem combo is not
     fully supported under Linux. Actually, NIC seems to work, but the
     modem part is a "winmodem". Nobody knows if HP would do something
     to solve that issue. All I could say is to avoid HP Omnibook 6000
     if modem activities are your primary tasks. Of course, you may
     spend some $$$ and buy another PCI mini-card with supported modem
     chip. Beside that, HP's 15" screen gives you great picture with the
     resolution of up to 1400 x 1050 at 16 bit colors. Interestingly,
     that resolution seems to be default under Windows 2000 and it is
     also easily adopted under Linux (RedHat 7.1). There is also
     somewhat "over-sensible" touchpad that often acts as the left mouse
     click. It seems to be a common feature for both Windows and Linux
     installations. It bothers me sometimes, but your mileage may vary.
  ·  The plan is to convert the FAT32 partition to the NTFS in order to
     get more reliable Windows subsystem. On the other side, Linux main
     (root) partition should be "shrinked" in order to get some free
     space. That free space will be used later for exchanging files
     between these two operating systems (probably it will be also FAT).



  7.  How to install Mandrake Linux 9.1 on HP products

  2003-11-19


  7.1.  Description of the products used in this experiment

  Notice: Folks, that part of the article is NOT a commercial for HP
  production of any means! In fact, a series of their machines I use has
  lots of failures in the power supply units, as well as with their hard
  disks. On the other side, laptop's batteries get exhausted earlier
  than expected.  Other than these issues, HP machines are fine.


  HP Omnibook 6000

  A laptop computer Omnibook 6000 is equipped with a bootable DVD drive.
  On the other hand I have supplied a bootable DVD-ROM with Mandrake
  Linux 9.1 installation. After booting the laptop with that bootable
  DVD, it gets directly to the installation menu, asking the user to
  choose a language to use for the rest of the installation.


  HP Vectra VL420 (used as a server)

  In opposite, an HP Vectra VL420 doesn't have a DVD drive (it only has
  a CD drive), so the direct installation from that particular
  installation DVD is not possible. But, an option of making a bootable
  floppy disk for starting the installation procedure is possible. In
  fact, several boot images are available for those users who don't have
  (bootable or not) DVD drive. One of the images is a 'network' one.
  That means, in a local area network there has to be either a NFS, FTP
  or HTTP server from which the installation will take place.


  HP Vectra VL420 (used as a workstation)

  Another VL420 desktop system I also use, has a spare HDD from a
  previous Windows 2000 server installation (actually, that IDE disk was
  moved from the other computer where it was a primary one and here it
  is the second one disk for backup data). The nice things is that it
  has a HTTP and FTP servers installed (of course, usable if the system
  is boot from that disk).  That was good so I could use one of these
  servers now. On the other hand, that particular Vectra VL420 was used
  to install a workstation kind of Linux (that time, using its first
  hard disk - having Windows 2000 Professional).



  7.2.  Installation procedure

  System boot of the laptop

  As explained earlier, the laptop has a bootable DVD drive, so that's
  it.

  System boot of desktop machines

  So, I made a 'network' bootable floppy and booted the first Vectra
  VL420 (intended to be a Linux server) with it. After a while, it came
  to a point to choose the installation method (NFS or FTP or HTTP
  server). At first, I wanted to use the second 'spare' HTTP server on
  the other Vectra, but regardless of what permission I tried to give to
  the 'Everyone' group of Windows users, I always got the following
  answer from the Linux setup:

  Error: Couldn't get file ... (or something like that)

  Then I tried to use the 'spare' FTP server from the second Vectra and,
  at first, it also asked for local and remote IP addresses. That time
  successfully, it started to load a part of the remote Linux files into
  its memory without any complaint. Soon after, it came to the very same
  position as Omnibook 6000 did: it got directly to the installation
  menu, asking a user to choose a language for the installation use.

  >From that point, the setup process was almost the same...

  I have chosen/confirmed the following items:

  - a language to use, besides English(American) as default: I added
  Unicode and Serbian (both Cyrillic and Latin); - a mouse and keyboard;
  - a security level - I accepted defaults: 'Standard' for laptop and
  'Higher' for server;

  The next important task was to choose one of DrakX partitioning
  options:

  - for laptop I chose the 'Use the free space on the Windows
  partition', because the laptop has one IDE hard disk and I wanted it
  to use a part of it for Linux (besides existing Windows 2000 Prof.
  already installed). Windows' Disk Management reported:



  Disk 0  15      MB      FAT     (HP Diagnostics or like)
          7.13    GB      FAT32   (C: "HPNOTEBOOK")
          20.80   GB      Free space



  The two partitions (FAT & FAT32) were made during the installation
  procedure, using HP's supplied installation CD's.

  At the first moment, Linux setup complained that my Windows partition
  "was too fragmented" and required me to reboot under Windows, run the
  "defrag" utility, then restart the Mandrake Linux installation.  The
  defragmentation process have taken cca. 1.5 hour to be completed!
  When restarted the setup, it wanted to use 7.13 GB Windows partition,
  instead of 20.80 GB. I chose to 'Use the free space'. Then it made
  partitions for Linux: /dev/hda5 and /dev/hda7.

  - for Vectra VL420 I used 'Custom disk partitioning' because there I
  had two SCSI disks, one of them running Windows 2000 Server already
  installed, and the other one I wanted to use entirely for a Linux
  server. BTW, I wasn't sure what the option 'Erase entire disk' would
  do during its next step (erase a whole disk or a partition?), although
  it also may be the proper solution too. DrakX recognized the two SCSI
  disks as sda and sdb and I chose sdb to install Linux. The first step
  was to 'Clear all' and after that to 'Auto allocate' the space on that
  second disk.  Finally, after a 'Done' it appeared to make /dev/sdb1
  and /dev/sdb6 Linux partitions.

  Package Group Selection

  Per default, the Mandrake 9.1 setup offers the following to be
  installed:



  - Office Workstation
  - Internet Workstation
  - KDE Workstation
  - Gnome Workstation



  that is in sum: Total size 1010/5267 (at laptop) and 1066/5265 (at
  server).

  - for laptop I added all that was available, excepting 6 'Server'
  items (1612/5267),

  - for server I added all that was available, including 6 'Server'
  items (1708/5265).

  Then I got an info, related to selecting following servers (?) on
  laptop:

  cups, postfix, rwho, webmin

  and on server box:

  cups, openssh-server, postfix, proftpd, rwho, webmin, ypserv, bind and
  nfs-utils.

  Although I was confused about the 'servers' to be installed on a
  laptop, I have accepted those things to be installed, considering them
  needed for the proper installation of other packages.

  The installation started ...

  Interestingly, although the installation on the laptop was performed
  directly from its DVD drive, the package installation process was
  significantly faster on the server box. I suppose that was due the
  difference in performances between server's SCSI disk and laptop's IDE
  disk.

  After that step was finished, and after entering a password for root,
  setup asked to 'Enter a user' (an ordinary user). The difference
  between laptop and server installation was that the latter offered
  some additional tasks for the (ordinary) user:



  - access to compilation tools (ctools)
  - access to rpm tools (rpm)
  - access to X programs (xgrp)
  - access to network tools (ntools)
  - access to administrative files (adm)
  - allow "su" (wheel)



  ... and that should be the same for other (new added) users.

  Then laptop suggested to 'set up computer to automatically log on one
  user'.  I didn't accept such a solution because I wanted each user to
  enter his/her password every time he/she is about to log on to the
  system.

  On the other hand, server's setup skipped that particular step and
  asked where to install the bootloader. I have chosen to use 'First
  sector of drive (MBR)'.

  Soon after, a 'Summary' screen appeared, so I could fine tune the
  installation.  I changed the following items:



  - timezone: Belgrade (both machines)
  - Graphical Interface (reported as 'not configured' on the laptop? - I tried
     with 'Flat Panel 1400 x 1050' because that resolution runs fine under
     Windows), X server: Rage Mobility, XFree 4.3 and 16 million colors -
     24 bits). On laptop, I chose XFree to start when I reboot. On server, it
     offered 800 x 600 - due to a recognized monitor Samsung SyncMaster
     510(M)s (CHA5807*) and card ATI Rage 128 and 16 bit - 65 thousand color.
  - Sound card: laptop is ESS Technology|ES1983S Maestro-3i|PCI Audio and
     server is Intel Corporation|ICH2 810 Chipset AC'97 Audio Controller.
  - Network: with 'Use auto detection'. Results: on laptop it recognized 'LAN
     connection - ethernet card(s) detected'; on server it recognized
     nothing. So, on server I chose to configure 'LAN connection'.
     Drivers are: 3c59x (laptop), eepro100 (server).
     IP addresses for both laptop and server.
     Host name: laptop, server, Gateway:
  - Firewall: disabled (def.)
  - Botloader: lilo-graphic on /dev/hda (laptop)
     lilo-graphic on /dev/sda (server)
     default boot: windows on /dev/hda2 (laptop)
     windows on /dev/sda1 (server)
  - Services: 32 activated for 47 registered (laptop)
     24 activated for 60 registered (server)



  Soon after ...

  Congratulations, installation is complete.

  (reboot)


  Installation results

  The next Windows boot made a screen 'System Settings Change': Windows
  2000 has finished installing new devices. You must restart your
  computer before the new settings will take effect. Do you want to
  restart your computer now? Well, I said

  Windows' Disk Management has showed new Linux partitions:



  - laptop:       5.85 GB         Healthy \
  Disk 0          495 MB          Healthy - all 3 are logical drives within the extended one
  27.95 GB        14.46 GB        Healthy /

  - server:       5.85 GB         Healthy - primary partition
  Disk 1          494 MB          Healthy \
  17.12 GB        10.79 GB        Healthy - these 2 are logical drives within the extended one



  It seems that /boot and /swap partitions are very similar in size,
  regardless the disk sizes, but / (root, home etc) partitions depend on
  disk size. Note that at my 'laptop' box I used the same HD of 27.95 GB
  for both Windows and Linux (for Windows 7.13 GB FAT32 of 27.95 GB
  available, the rest, cca. 20 GB for Linux).

  At the 'server' box I have two HD's of 17.12 GB each, and I used Disk
  0 (the 1st one) entirely for Windows 2000 Server, and Disk 1 (the 2nd
  one) entirely for Linux.

  The first Mandrake Linux boot screen:

  - laptop: a screen with only a name of a user (no root available!),
  Reboot and Halt buttons.

  - server: a screen with 'Enter Login', 'Enter Password' and 'Session
  type' (no name of a user appeared).

  First Time Wizard: Default KDE (both)

  ...

  What about the Ctrl-Alt-Del action:

  - laptop: a screen 'End Session for "username"' What do you want to do
  next?  Login as different user, Turn off computer, Restart computer,
  OK and Cancel buttons.

  - server: a screen 'End Session for "username"', Logout and Cancel
  buttons.

  After choosing Login as different user (at laptop), or Logout (at
  server), what appeared were the same screens as described in 'The
  first Mandrake Linux boot screen' section.

  boot the systems in the examples above, you should refer to the LILO

  HP Vectra VL420 (workstation - desktop client)

  As mentioned before, HP Vectra VL420 doesn't have a DVD drive (it only
  has a CD drive), so the installation from that particular DVD
  installation was not possible. But, an option of making a bootable
  floppy disk for it was possible. In fact, several boot images are
  available for those users who don't have (bootable or not) DVD drive.
  One of the images was a 'network' one. That means, in a local network
  there should be a NFS, FTP or HTTP server from which the installation
  will take place.  As earlier explained, a Windows 2000 server machine
  (that I earlier used for Mandrake Linux server installation), has HTTP
  and FTP servers installed. That was good so I could use one of them
  now.

  So, I used the 'network' bootable floppy and booted Vectra VL420 with
  it. After a while, it came to a point to choose the installation
  method (NFS or FTP or HTTP server). At first I wanted to use my HTTP
  server but regardless of what permission I gave to 'Everyone' I always
  got the answer from Linux installation program: Error: Couldn't get
  file ...

  Then I tried to use my FTP server (on the same Windows server) and it
  also asked for IP local and remote addresses. Then it started to load
  a part of the remote files into its memory.  Soon after, it came to
  the very same position as Omnibook 6000 did: it gets directly to the
  installation menu, asking for choosing a language to use.

  >From that point, the installation procedure was almost the same...


  I have chosen/confirmed the following items:



  - a language to use - besides English(American) I also added
  Unicode and Serbian, both Cyrillic and Latin;
  - a mouse and keyboard;
  - a security level - default 'Standard';



  The next important point was to choose one of DrakX partitioning
  options:

  - At first I used the 'Use the free space on the Windows partition'
  because it has one IDE hard disk and I wanted it to use a part of it
  for Linux (besides existing Windows 2000 Prof.  already installed).

  At the first moment, Linux setup complained that my Windows partition
  "was too fragmented" and asked me to reboot under Windows, run the
  "defrag" utility, then restart the Mandrake Linux installation.  After
  defragmentation process was finished, I tried once again the to
  'shrink' Windows partition from cca. 30 gig to cca. 28 gig. Then I
  used Partition Magic software and tried to shrink it to cca. 20 GB in
  order to get more free space for Linux.

  Than I tried 'Custom disk partitioning', chose the first IDE disk
  (hda) of 27GB, chose action 'Resize'. That one option was not good
  because it just offered Windows partition to get larger instead of
  smaller than before. Finally I used 'Use the free space' and it
  automatically made Linux partitions. In fact, on that one Vectra I
  have two IDE disks, one of them having Windows 2000 Server already
  installed, and the other one having Windows 2000 Prof. that I wanted
  to use partly for Linux. After 'Done' it came to making /dev/hda5 and
  /dev/hda7.

  Package Group Selection

  Per default, Mandrake installation offers the following:



  - Office Workstation
  - Internet Workstation
  - KDE Workstation
  - Gnome Workstation



  in sum, Total size 1009/5105 (client).

  - for client I added everything else (1638/5105), excepting 6 'Server'
  items.

  Then I got an info, related to selecting following server(s) on
  client:

  cups, postfix, rwho, webmin

  I have accepted those things to be installed.

  The installation started ...

  After that step was finished, and after entering password for root,
  setup asked to 'Enter a user' (an ordinary user). The difference
  between client and server installation was that the latter offered
  some additional tasks for the user:



  - access to compilation tools (ctools)
  - access to rpm tools (rpm)
  - access to X programs (xgrp)
  - access to network tools (ntools)
  - access to administrative files (adm)
  - allow "su" (wheel)



  ... and that would be the same for other (new added) users.

  Then client suggested to 'set up computer to automatically log on one
  user'.  I didn't accept that because I wanted each user to enter
  his/her password every time he/she is about to login to the system.

  Soon after, a 'Summary' screen appeared, so I could tune the
  installation.  I changed the following items:



  - timezone: Belgrade
  - Graphical Interface: it offered 1280 x 1024 - due to a 'custom' monitor
     and card NVIDIA GeForce2 DDR (generic) - 24 bit 16 million colors.
  - Sound card: Intel Corporation|ICH2 810 Chipset AC'97 Audio Controller.
  - Network: with 'Use auto detection'. Results: recognized nothing. So, I
     chose to configure 'LAN connection'.
     Driver is: eepro100.
     IP address
     Host name: client, Gateway:
  - Firewall: disabled (def.)
  - Botloader: lilo-graphic on /dev/hda
     default boot: windows on /dev/hda1
  - Services: 32 activated for 47 registered (the same as laptop)



  Soon after ...

  Congratulations, installation is complete.

  (reboot)


  Installation results (all 3 systems)


  - laptop options: windows, linux, failsafe, floppy;
  - client options: windows, linux, linux-nonfb, failsafe, windows2, floppy
  - server options: windows, linux, linux-nonfb, linux-secure, failsafe



  Notes:


  - 'windows2' option at the client box is, in fact, Windows 2000 Server
  installation located on the second HD.

  - Not sure why 'laptop' doesn't have 'linux-nonfb' text boot option,
  although it looks like it boots to Linux in just like that mode (maybe
  it is a matter of the laptop's LCD screen capabilities or something
  like that). On the other hand, client and server differ in floppy and
  linux-secure options (perhaps as some security measures or like).

  - 'linux-secure' option at the server box may be a result of a
  'Higher' security level, that I have chosen at the beginning of the
  installation or, maybe, there are some special server security
  features.

  The next Windows boot made a screen 'System Settings Change': Windows
  2000 has finished installing new devices. You must restart your
  computer before the new settings will take effect. Do you want to
  restart your computer now? Well, I said Yes.

  Windows Disk Management has showed new Linux partitions (comparison of
  3 systems):



  - laptop:       5.85 GB         Healthy \
  Disk 0          495 MB          Healthy - all 3 are logical drives within the extended one
  27.95 GB        14.46 GB        Healthy /

  - client:       5.68 GB         Healthy \
  Disk 0          494 MB          Healthy - all 3 are logical drives within the extended one
  37.28 GB        3.52GB          Healthy / (same as laptop)

  - server:       5.85 GB         Healthy - primary partition
  Disk 1          494 MB          Healthy \
  17.12 GB        10.79 GB        Healthy - these two are logical drives within extended



  It seems that /boot and /swap partitions are very similar in size,
  regardless the disk sizes, but / (root, home etc) partitions depend on
  disk size. Note that at my 'client' box I used the same HD of 37.28 GB
  for both Windows and Linux (for Windows 27.60 GB NTFS of 37.28 GB
  available, the rest, cca. 10 GB for Linux).

  At the 'server' box I have two HD's of 17.12 GB each, and I used Disk
  0 (the 1st one) entirely for Windows 2000 Server, and Disk 1 (the 2nd
  one) entirely for Linux.  That's why Mandrake setup allocated 'less'
  space for / at the larger disk (in fact, at the 'server' box, it
  allocated relatively much more space for / even that HD is smaller -
  because that HD is 'dedicated' for Linux only.

  The first Mandrake Linux boot screen:

  - laptop: a screen with only a name of a user (no root available!),
  Reboot and Halt buttons.

  - client: a screen with only a name of a user (no root available!),
  Reboot and Halt buttons.

  - server: a screen with 'Enter Login', 'Enter Password' and 'Session
  type' (no name of a user appeared, but root may also login there!).

  First Time Wizard: Default KDE (client, just like the others)

  There is a difference between KDE screens at client and server: the
  client VL420 offers 'CD-ROM mounted at /mnt/cdrom' and 'Floppy mounted
  at /mnt/floppy' but server Vectra VL420 (having the same type of
  devices!) doesn't.  Besides that, if a flash storage is connected to a
  USB port, before Linux being started, there will also appear an icon
  for it. Interestingly, at server there's no something like that. I
  consider, that is also a matter of the difference between the client
  and server types of Mandrake Linux installations, or maybe a matter of
  some security measures for server-type installations. Whatever it is,
  I see that as a shortage of confortable for Mandrake Linux servers.
  Case some of you, the readers, has some workarounds on that issues,
  your contributions are welcomed!

  Besides that, KDE's Panel at client offers 'Mandrake Control Center -
  System configuration tool' (although useful only under root
  privileges), and KDE's Panel at server doesn't have that (in fact, an
  'ordinary' user may access the same tool from the Start Applications
  menu and, again, to use it after the root's password entered). It
  makes me wonder why they at Mandrake did it like that. Maybe they
  didn't want 'ordinary' users to access some configuration tools as
  easily ...

  ...

  What about the Ctrl-Alt-Del:

  - laptop: a screen 'End Session for "username"' What do you want to do
  next?  Login as different user, Turn off computer, Restart computer,
  OK and Cancel buttons.

  - client: a screen 'End Session for "username"' What do you want to do
  next?  Login as different user, Turn off computer, Restart computer,
  OK and Cancel buttons.

  - server: a screen 'End Session for "username"', Logout and Cancel
  buttons.

  After choosing Login as different user what appeared were the same
  screen as described in 'The first Mandrake Linux boot screen' section.

  Should you want to learn more about LILO (Linux Loader), configured to
  boot the systems in the examples above, you should refer to the LILO
  <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO.html> mini-HOWTO.

  There is also a difference between client and server behavior when it
  is about to shutdown (halt) the system. A user is capable to halt the
  system even from the login screen at client (that is not available at
  server). On the other hand, a user has to know root password to halt
  the system at server.


  7.3.  General issues with the Mandrake 9.1 Linux installation

  A 'Network' bootable installation floppy should also be capable to
  reach Mandrake installation files not only from NFS, FTP or HTTP
  servers, but files that are copied to shared disks on machines within
  the local network.  When an image is called a 'Network' image, that
  means, IMHO, all kinds of network locations should be accessible - NOT
  only those specific server-type locations like NFS, FTP or HTTP
  servers. In fact, if a user in a local network doesn't have NFS, FTP
  or HTTP servers, but has the installation packages copied somewhere
  else on the LAN, there should be a way to access those packages too.

  The workstation-like installations do not offer a 'root' account to be
  used from the graphical login window (I suppose that 'su' or 'sudo'
  actions are available - I haven't tested them yet). That might be a
  problem in cases when a user misconfigures his/her account and when
  the administrator has to login to the system to fix that problem. At
  the moment, I am not sure how the administrator could do that without
  having the 'root' login ability (perhaps using virtual text consoles
  accessed with CTRL-ALT-F1, CTRL-ALT-F2 ... , then starting GUI if
  needed, etc ...)



  Some issues after the Mandrake 9.1 Linux installation:


  Talking about the behavior of Mandrake 9.1 - related to the type of
  installation (a workstation or a workstation/server combination) - it
  seems that there are some other differences. As already mentioned, on
  a workstation desktop there are icons for CD and FD drives (although
  maybe not already being mounted at the moment of the system boot). As
  well, if a USB flash storage is connected to the USB port, there is
  also an icon of an sda (SCSI ?) USB storage available. On the other
  hand, in case of workstation/server installations - there are no icons
  of those devices at all. It seems that the server installation
  considers that is better to live without these devices in case of a
  server :-)  Any comments are welcomed.


  Related to writing and testing HOWTO's. I prefer to write a 'HOWTO'
  document using a text editor and make it with a .sgml extension. Then
  I use the old, good sgml2html tool to make HTML pages, in order to
  check how these pages will look like. Well, that's OK under Red Hat
  7.1 but under Mandrake 9.1 it seems that I am not able to find the
  same tool. Any idea on that task?



  8.  Linux accompanied with Windows 2000 and Windows XP

  2005-10-09

  Recently I had a hard-disk failure and my more_than_a_year old
  Linux/Windows 2000 home system disappeared. When considering what to
  have on a new purchased disk, I decided to try Linux with both Windows
  2000 and Windows XP.


  In short, the new disk was of 40 GB and I made a half of it (20 GB) a
  NTFS partition for Windows XP. It became so called C: disk. The second
  partition of 10 GB (FAT32) became D: disk of Windows 2000. As usual,
  you have to repeat installations of Microsoft products for several
  times - before they even start behaving partly as you expect from
  them. To be more precize, it looked that Windows 2000 had to be
  installed before Windows XP, in order its boot entry got a part of
  XP's list of boot entries (If I remember, I tried it the opposite way
  and it didn't work).


  Then I used the remaining 10 GB to install Mandrake 9.1 (Bamboo) and I
  made it without problems - The only minor issue was that a try of
  disk-type installation where Linux files were placed on an existing
  NTFS partition failed because Linux setup actually did not manage to
  locate installation files on a NTFS partition. (That was why I made
  Windows 2000 installation on a FAT32 file system - because later I
  could use it for Mandrake 9.1 disk-type setup).


  So far - so good. One of the main things I wanted to make working
  within all three environments was the e-mail client. You bet, an
  another open source solution was available: the Mozilla suite. For
  Windows operating systems I used Mozilla 1.7.11 and for Linux I used
  Mozilla 1.6 (an older xft version - some newer ones I was not able to
  install).  And, as usual for me, I wanted all of them to share my
  mailbox files, i.e. I wanted to access my incoming emails from all and
  each operating system - booted at the time.


  In order to make that possible, I chose Mozilla under Windows 2000
  (FAT32) to become the 'central location' for saving the mailbox files.
  That means I had to make some changes within other two Mozilla's
  configurations - to make them capable to read/write from/to the first
  chosen mailbox location (FAT32). For Linux I did the following:


  Instead of keeping an 'original' Linux-native location:

  /home/misko/.mozilla/default/fydeba98.slt/Mail/solair.eunet.yu


  I changed to this mounted one:

  /mnt/win_d/Documents and Settings/misko/Application Data/Mozilla/Profiles/default/oeu1tmbd.slt/Mail/solair.eunet.yu



  As a result of that change, now it is possible for me to download
  email messages from within one O.S. - then to read them from another
  O.S. - and finally reply/send the email from the 3rd one environment.
  The only minor drawback is that each operating system is likely to In
  order to get a 'refreshed' state of e-mail folders, a user has to
  click on a mailbox name. Another solution is to activate an option of


  What belongs to my 'wish-list' now, is to continue upgrading all three
  Mozilla's (at least that old one v1.6 that runs under Mandrake).  It
  makes me wonder if I could use a 'regular' one (instead of xft's) -
  although I remember that older regular's were producing awful fonts
  under Linux environment. I am not sure if things got improved.


  The second important task is to install one of the most popular radio
  amateur software, also an open-source, called LinFBB (FBB for Linux).
  More details related to that you can find in another Linux manual: the
  FBB <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/FBB.html>HOWTO.



  9.  Bibliography

  2010-07-18

  Notice: I often participate in various (inter)national ICT conferences
  in Serbia and abroad, presenting technical papers and delivering half-
  day and full-day tutorials, covering basic ideas and useful mission of
  the amateur radio hobby and its possible usage in engineering
  education. What I have been doing is to spread - as much as possible -
  the knowledge about existing open source products, including Linux and
  amateur radio free software. Besides that, I have been writing various
  articles for a variety of scientific and other magazines. Here you
  have the list of those articles and paper topics submitted to the
  conferences.

  Besides the published articles and presented works, I am also a member
  of the following associations: IEEE Computer Society, IEEE
  Communications Society, WSEAS and ACM. In addition, I work on
  establishing an academic computer network that would use the amateur
  radio stations as the media.  Some kinds of proposed networks exist
  elsewhere on this planet and I invite their administrators to contact
  me in order to cooperate.

  You are strongly recommended to take a backup of your system before
  major installation and backups at regular intervals.


  10.3.  News

  This is not the first release of this mini-HOWTO. I hope to improve it
  whenever possible. Besides that, there are other documents that may
  help you to install more than one operating system on the same
  computer.  You may look for them at the same location where you get
  Linux+WindowsNT mini-HOWTO.

  This mini-HOWTO would be improved from time to time. If you think that
  the HOWTO on your Linux installation CD is some out-of-date, you may
  check for newest release on the Internet. It could be found within the
  main Linux Documentation Project <http://www.tldp.org/> or some of its
  mirrors.


  10.4.  Credits

  This version of Linux+WinNT mini-HOWTO is based on:



       The Linux+WindowsNT mini-HOWTO
       by Bill Wohler, wohler@newt.com
       v1.1, 19 February 1997



  Credit also goes to:



       Dragomir Kalaba, a local Linux 'guru'



  Any comments or suggestions can be mailed to my email address: skoric
  at eunet dot rs


  10.5.  HOWTO

  These are intended as the primary starting points to get the
  background information as well as show you how to solve a specific
  problem.  Some relevant HOWTOs are Bootdisk, Installation,  SCSI and
  UMSDOS.  The main site for these is the LDP archive
  <http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/> at Metalab (formerly known as Sunsite).


  10.6.  Mini-HOWTO

  These are the smaller free text relatives to the HOWTOs.  Some
  relevant mini-HOWTOs are Backup-With-MSDOS, Diskless, LILO, Large
  Disk, Linux+DOS+Win95+OS2, Linux+OS2+DOS, Linux+Win95,
  Linux+WindowsNT, Linux+NT-Loader, NFS-Root, Win95+Win+Linux, ZIP
  Drive, FBB packet-radio BBS.  You can find these at the same place as
  the HOWTOs, usually in a sub directory called mini. Note that these
  are scheduled to be converted into SGML and become proper HOWTOs in
  the near future.


  10.7.  Local Resources

  In most distributions of Linux there is a document directory
  installed, have a look in the /usr/doc directory.  where most packages
  store their main documentation and README files etc.  Also you will
  here find the HOWTO archive ( /usr/doc/HOWTO) of ready formatted
  HOWTOs and also the mini-HOWTO archive ( /usr/doc/HOWTO/mini
  <file:///usr/doc/HOWTO/mini>) of plain text documents.

  Many of the configuration files mentioned earlier can be found in the
  /etc directory. In particular you will want to work with the
  /etc/fstab file that sets up the mounting of partitions and possibly
  also /etc/mdtab file that is used for the md system to set up RAID.

  The kernel source in /usr/src/linux <file:///usr/src/linux> is, of
  course, the ultimate documentation. In other words, use the source,
  Luke.  It should also be pointed out that the kernel comes not only
  with source code which is even commented (well, partially at least)
  but also an informative documentation directory
  <file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation>.  If you are about to ask any
  questions about the kernel you should read this first, it will save
  you and many others a lot of time and possibly embarrassment.

  Also have a look in your system log file ( /var/log/messages) to see
  what is going on and in particular how the booting went if too much
  scrolled off your screen. Using tail -f /var/log/messages in a
  separate window or screen will give you a continuous update of what is
  going on in your system.

  You can also take advantage of the /proc file system that is a window
  into the inner workings of your system.  Use cat rather than more to
  view the files as they are reported as being zero length. Reports are
  that less works well here.


  10.8.  Web Pages

  There is a huge number of informative web pages out there and by their
  very nature they change quickly so don't be too surprised if these
  links become quickly outdated.

  A good starting point is of course the Linux Documentation Project
  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/> home page, or this one: Linux
  Documentation Project <http://www.tldp.org/> an information central
  for documentation, project pages and much, much more.

  Please let me know if you have any other leads that can be of
  interest.



  11.  Getting help


  In the end you might find yourself unable to solve your problems and
  need help from someone else. The most efficient way is either to ask
  someone local or in your nearest Linux user group, search the web for
  the nearest one.
  Another possibility is to ask on Usenet News in one of the many, many
  newsgroups available. The problem is that these have such a high
  volume and noise (called low signal-to-noise ratio) that your question
  can easily fall through unanswered.

  No matter where you ask it is important to ask well or you will not be
  taken seriously. Saying just my disk does not work is not going to
  help you and instead the noise level is increased even further and if
  you are lucky someone will ask you to clarify.

  Instead describe your problems in some detail that will enable people
  to help you. The problem could lie somewhere you did not expect.
  Therefore you are advised to list up the following information on your
  system:


     Hardware

        ·  Processor

        ·  DMA

        ·  IRQ

        ·  Chip set (LX, BX etc)

        ·  Bus (ISA, VESA, PCI etc)

        ·  Expansion cards used (Disk controllers, video, IO etc)


     Software

        ·  BIOS (On motherboard and possibly SCSI host adapters)

        ·  LILO, if used

        ·  Linux kernel version as well as possible modifications and
           patches

        ·  Kernel parameters, if any

        ·  Software that shows the error (with version number or date)


     Peripherals

        ·  Type of disk drives with manufacturer name, version and type

        ·  Other relevant peripherals connected to the same busses


  Remember that booting text is logged to /var/log/messages which can
  answer most of the questions above. Obviously if the drives fail you
  might not be able to get  the log saved to disk but you can at least
  scroll back up the screen using the SHIFT and PAGE UP keys. It may
  also be useful to include part of this in your request for help but do
  not go overboard, keep it brief as a complete log file dumped to
  Usenet News is more than a little annoying.
