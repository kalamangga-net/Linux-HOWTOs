  1.  Introduction


  This document is maintained by Dave Whitinger (dave@linuxtoday.com).
  Please mail me with any questions or ideas you have regarding this
  HOWTO.

  This document will attempt to describe the following four things:


  1. Installing the TkRat E-Mail program.

  2. Downloading mail from an Internet Service Provider.

  3. Reading, storing, and sending mail

  4. Sorting the mail into folders

  The document assumes that you are running Linux with the X Window
  System, have already established a connection to an Internet Service
  Provider, and have a POP account with that provider.

  2.  Installing TkRat

  I would like to stress that there are many excellent E-Mail programs
  available for Linux.  It is always a matter of personal preference
  when selecting which one you will use.  That said, I will tell you
  that I have been using a program called "TkRat" for over 2 years now -
  and I love it.  It's a graphical program that has all the features you
  would expect from a quality mail program, it's easy to learn how to
  use, it's powerful, and it's free.  For these reasons, I'll only be
  covering TkRat in this HOWTO.

  The first thing you need to do is download TkRat.  You can either
  obtain the sources and compile them, or you can get the binaries.

  Here are some URLs for the software:


  ·  ftp://ftp.md.chalmers.se/pub/tkrat/tkrat-2.0b3.tar.gz
     <ftp://ftp.md.chalmers.se/pub/tkrat/tkrat-2.0b3.tar.gz> (Download
     via ftp)

  ·  http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/~maf/ratatosk/tkrat-2.0b3.tar.gz
     <http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/~maf/ratatosk/tkrat-2.0b3.tar.gz>
     (Download via http)

  ·  http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/~maf/ratatosk/download.html
     <http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/~maf/ratatosk/download.html> (Download
     page - check for the latest version!)

  When you have downloaded the tarfile, you are ready to install it on
  your system.

  To install the tar.gz source, use the commands:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  tar -zcvpf tkrat-2.0b3.tar.gz
  cd tkrat-2.0b3
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  ______________________________________________________________________


  If anything fails, consult the INSTALL and README files located in the
  tkrat-2.0b3 directory.  Note that you will need a version of tcl that
  is greater than 8.1 for this to compile.  You can obtain the latest
  tcl from scriptics.com <http://www.scriptics.com/>.


  Congratulations - TkRat should now be installed on your system.


  3.  Downloading your E-Mail

  In order to read E-Mail, it is usually best to download it using a
  program called "fetchmail".  The following instructions are known to
  work perfectly for version 2.2 of fetchmail - although they should be
  applicable to any version.

  (Note: Fetchmail is almost certainly already installed on your system,
  as it is included in all Linux distributions that I know of - if
  anyone knows this to be untrue, please let me know!).

  Perform the following steps:



  ______________________________________________________________________
  echo "server pop.com protocol pop3 username dave password foo" > ~/.fetchmailrc

  (Make sure to replace "pop.com" with the hostname to your ISP's pop server.  Replace
  "dave" with your username, and replace "foo" with your username's password.)
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Now, whenever you want to check your E-Mail, just type "fetchmail" at
  the prompt.  Fetchmail will go off and download all your mail and
  store it in your local mail folder.



  4.  Configuring TkRat


  >From the prompt, type "tkrat" and press enter.  Click on "Create".
  Read the message it gives you, then click on "Continue".  At this
  point, you are brought to the main TkRat program.  The first thing you
  should do is customize it to your local system.


  1. Go the Admin menu, and select Preferences.

  2. Click on "Sending"

  3. Enter in your E-Mail address in the "Default Reply-To" field.

  4. Enter in your E-Mail address, followed by paranthesis in the "Use
     from address" field.  e.g. dave@linuxtoday.com (Dave Whitinger)

  5. Enter your domain name in the "Domain" field.  If your E-Mail
     address is "user@xyz.com" you'll enter "xyz.com".

  6. Click on "Apply".

  7. Click on "Method".

  8. For "Send Via" select "SMPT".

  9. In the SMTP host: field, enter the SMPT server address of your ISP
     (they should be able to provide you with this information).

  10.
     Click "Apply", then "Dismiss".


  5.  Using TkRat


  Upon starting TkRat, You'll notice that you are in a folder called
  "INBOX".  Use fetchmail to download any new mail.  If you have any, it
  will appear in this INBOX folder.

  TkRat has an intuitive interface.  The top half of the screen is the
  list of messages you have (Each line is a seperate E-Mail).  The
  bottom half of the screen will be the actual content of the E-Mail.

  You can read E-Mails by simply clicking on any message in the list.

  When you are finished reading a message, you can move on the next
  message, reply to that message, compose a new message, or move the
  message to a different "Folder".

  Folders are a way of storing E-Mails into seperate "Folders".  This
  way, you can keep several folders for different topics you may receive
  E-Mail about.

  Perform the following steps to create folders:

  1. Click on Admin, then New/Edit Folders

  2. You will see a box with a "INBOX" folder.  Left-Click in that box.

  3. You are then presented with a menu, so select "New File Folder".

  4. You'll be given a dialogue box asking for information.

  5. In the first textbox - enter a name for the folder.

  6. In the second textbox - enter the filename you will use to store
     the messages in (Hint: Use something like
     /home/username/mail/name_of_folder.  So, if the first field says
     "Personal", the second field would say something like
     "/home/dave/mail/personal" (assuming your username is dave).

  7. Click OK.  You'll notice your new folder is now in the list of
     folders.  So, go to "Window" and then "Close".

  You can now Move messages to the new folder - and switch to that
  folder by selecting the folder's name under the "Folders" menu.

  Sending mail is also easy.  Click "Compose", type in the recipient's
  E-Mail address, type in a subject, and then write the message in the
  body.

  When you are finished, click on Send.


  6.  Automatically sorting mail into folders


  If you're like me, you get about 3,500 messages a day.  Each time you
  fetch your mail, you have to wade through all the messages looking for
  particular ones that interest you.

  This is not a problem anymore, thanks to Procmail.

  Procmail works like this: Procmail examines each message as it is
  downloaded, and will perform a series of tasks based upon certain
  rules that you've specified.

  Let's say, for example, that I get about 200 messages every day from a
  certain mailing list (in this example, I'm using the linux-foo list).
  Rather than have all those messages go directly into my main inbox, I
  would rather that they were automatically filtered into a box called
  "foo-list".

  The first step is to take an example mail message that came from that
  mailing list and examine the mail headers.

  I begin to notice a pattern.  Every message that comes from that
  mailing list has a line that says:

  Sender: owner-linux-foo@bar.foogers.com

  I can now tell procmail to place every message that contains this line
  into a certain folder.


  The way I tell this to procmail is by way of a ".procmailrc" file.

  I will use my favorite text editor to create a text file in my home
  directory called ".procmailrc".

  The file will look something like this:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  LOGFILE=$HOME/.pmlog
  MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
  VERBOSE

  # linux-foo list
  :0 Hw
  * ^.*[Ss]ender: owner-linux-foo@bar.foogers.edu
  foo-list

  # if it got to this point, put it in my new mail folder
  :0 Hw
  newmail
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Examine the "[Ss]ender" line.  You'll notice that that line is the one
  thing that all messages from that mailing list have in common.

  That section is telling procmail that when it sees a message come
  through with a header that looks like the above, to put it into the
  "foo-list" folder.

  The next section is saying that if the message matched nothing above,
  to just place it into newmail.

  Now, let's say that anytime I get a message from my good friend, EJ, I
  want it to go into a folder called "EJ".

  I'll just create a new section of my procmailrc file.  See below:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  LOGFILE=$HOME/.pmlog
  MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
  VERBOSE

  # linux-foo list
  :0 Hw
  * ^.*[Ss]ender: owner-linux-foo@bar.foogers.edu
  foo-list

  # Message from E.J.!
  :0 Hw
  * ^.*[Ff]rom: ej@mypal.com
  ej

  # if it got to this point, put it in my new mail folder
  :0 Hw
  newmail
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Notice the new section for EJ.  When a message comes in with his E-
  Mail address in the "From" field, it will automatically place it into
  my "ej" folder.
  Now, let's say that there's some lamer out there who keeps on E-
  Mailing me.  I don't want to hear from him, but he's persistent.  Once
  again - procmail to the rescue.

  So, let's say I don't ever want to see any mail from Bill Gates.  I
  can setup a recipe to delete any mail that comes from him.  Look at my
  new procmailrc:


  ______________________________________________________________________

  LOGFILE=$HOME/.pmlog
  MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
  VERBOSE

  # Is it coming from Bill Gates?  If yes, DELETE IT!!!
  :0 Hw
  * ^.*[Ff]rom: bgates@microsoft.com
  /dev/null

  # linux-foo list
  :0 Hw
  * ^.*[Ss]ender: owner-linux-foo@bar.foogers.edu
  foo-list

  # Message from EJ!
  :0 Hw
  * ^.*[Ff]rom: ej@mypal.com
  ej

  # if it got to this point, put it in my new mail folder
  :0 Hw
  newmail
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Now I have a rather nice procmailrc file.  Let's examine what procmail
  will do to each message as it comes in.

  At first, it checks the message to see if it is from
  "bgates@microsoft.com". If it is, delete it, and it's done.

  If the message made it through the first check, it will see if it has
  the "owner-linux-foo@bar.foogers.edu" in the headers.  If it does, it
  will put it into the "foo-list" folder, and it's done.

  If the message still makes it past that, then it checks to see if it's
  from EJ.   If it is, it places it into the "ej" folder.

  Now, if the message passes all those tests, then it should just place
  it into my newmail folder.


  Once you have these folders in place and procmail is properly
  filtering the mail, you can just go into TkRat, "Admin - New/Edit
  Folder" and create the folders for each filename.  They will be
  located under /home/username/mail/foldername.

  Very special thanks go out to Martin Forsse'n (maf@dtek.chalmers.se)
  for authoring the TkRat mail user agent.

  Greetings go out to the North Texas Linux User's Group in Dallas, TX,
  for whom I originally wrote this document back in early 1998.  Today
  no greetings go out to any user groups, as I live in the moutains of
  East Tennessee, where I believe I am the only Linux user (or computer
  user, for that matter) within 50 miles.

  Also of note: Nic Bernstein <mailto:nic@postilion.org> has forked the
  TkRat code to create a mailer called Postilion
  <http://www.postilion.org/>.  It looks like a great mailer with a lot
  of new features that aren't in TkRat, but, nevertheless, I continue to
  use TkRat.
