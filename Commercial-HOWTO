  1.  About this document


  This is the Linux Commercial HOWTO.  It contains a listing of
  commercial software which is available for Linux.  The Linux
  Commercial HOWTO doesn't contain any information on Linux
  distributions -- this is covered by the Distribution HOWTO.


  If you contact any companies or purchase any products listed in this
  document, please mention the Linux Commercial HOWTO.



  This document was originated by Harald Milz <Harald.Milz@Linux.org>.
  and then maintained by Mr. Poet

  It is now maintained by Mr. Poet AND LinuxPorts <poet@linuxports.com>.

  If you need to know more about the Linux Documentation Project or
  about Linux HOWTO's, feel free to contact the supervisor Tim Bynum
  <linux-howto@metalab.unc.edu>.


  Tim Bynum will post the listing to several national and international
  newsgroups on a monthly basis.  In addition, the Linux Commercial
  HOWTO can be found on the World Wide Web at
  http://commercial.cyrius.com.  New versions of the Linux Commercial
  HOWTO are always placed at this site first, so please be sure to check
  if the copy you are reading is still up to date!


  The Linux Commercial HOWTO is not a forum for product announcements or
  marketing hype; it is a service for potential customers and the whole
  Linux community.  Resellers will not be listed; the list is for
  companies who produce their software themselves.  Two main goals are
  being aimed at:


  o  It shall help companies who want to run Linux to find software
     solutions and applications.  The international distribution of this
     list will enhance the contact opportunity.

  o  It is meant to prove the commercial useability of Linux and thus to
     encourage other vendors to port their software as well.

  Companies and developers who are offering their products for Linux and
  interested in joining the Linux Commercial HOWTO are invited to fill
  out the following form and contact me at poet@linuxports.com.


  This HOWTO contains tabular entries for each product (example
  follows).  The entry format is similar to the Linux Software Map (LSM)
  entry (field/stanza lengths are arbitrary).  If you want me to add
  your entry please keep short, otherwise I'll have to shorten your
  data.  Furthermore, please send me plain ASCII data; no HTML, and no
  PostScript.

  3.  Disclaimer


  This HOWTO is not actually a HOWTO in the sense of the Linux
  Documentation Project.  Instead, it is an instrument to investigate
  the commercial Linux opportunity and to list applications which were
  already ported and marketed in a native Linux version.  As a software
  vendor, you probably know that you can alternatively offer Linux users
  a statically linked SCO version of your application which would
  probably run under the iBCS2 emulator (albeit with a small performance
  penalty and higher memory requirements).  Such applications will not
  be listed here.

  I will not select nor deselect any particular product.  Instead,
  everyone who wants to have her product included will be serviced.
  However, I reserve the right to shorten individual entries to keep
  things in shape.

  If you don't find a particular product or vendor in this list, this is
  probably due to one of the following reasons:


  o  I never heard of that product or vendor and thus didn't try to get
     in contact.

  o  I did get in contact, but the vendor didn't answer yet.

  o  I did get in contact, but the vendor stated positively that he
     doesn't sell his product for Linux (yet).

  In any case, please get in contact if you feel someone's missing; also
  if you discover any errors in the file.

  Sometimes two vendor's addresses are mentioned in the ``Vendor:''
  field.  In these cases I received the information from the German
  subsidiary/distributor.  The original manufacturer's address is always
  mentioned first.

  5.  Linux for the Commercial Market?

  Copyright (C) 1996 iX Multiuser Multitasking Magazin
  Courtesy of iX Multiuser Multitasking Magazin!


  People keep asking me ``When is Linux going to be ready for the
  commercial market''.  I guess the first thing to discuss is what is
  meant by "commercial" in this context.


  Some CD-ROM vendors have put the word "commercial" in their name, only
  to have the technical people think their product is good only for use
  by banks and insurance companies.  Other people look at their product
  with disdain and say that ``Linux is not commercial quality'', because
  it is missing some feature they need, or they feel it is unstable
  (usually without ever trying it even one time).


  To me, the word ``commercial'' has lost as much meaning in the
  marketplace as some of the other buzzwords:



  o  ``Open'' vs ``Proprietary'' (People are now saying UNIX is
     ``Proprietary'')

  o  ``Workstation'' vs ``PC'' (What is a workstation, anyway?)

  In the old days of computing the commercial market was banks,
  insurance companies and business-oriented facilities where the use of
  COBOL or RPG was the mainstream.  The technical market was scientific,
  engineering and manufacturing where FORTRAN and assembly language was
  used.  Somewhere along the way the term ``commercial'' seems to have
  gotten twisted around to mean ``ready for the mass market'', versus
  ``ready for hackers''.


  For the purpose of this article I will take the second meaning, and
  address whether I think Linux is ready for commercial purposes rather
  than the hobbyist and hacker market, and ready for the mass market
  rather than limited markets.


  For those of you who hate reading long articles, or who are short on
  time, let me give you my conclusion right now.  Then you can go out
  and drink beer or other fun activities:


  ``Yes, Linux is ready for the commercial market...in some cases''.


  In order for an operating system to be ready for the mass market it
  must have several attributes:



  o  have lots of applications

  o  be relatively easy to install

  o  have lots of applications

  o  be relatively easy to maintain


  o  have lots of applications

  o  be relatively easy to use

  o  have lots of applications

  o  not crash (much)

  o  have lots of applications

  o  be economical

  o  have lots of applications

  But you can eliminate all of these considerations in today's mass
  market if only one thing is true:


  You have lots of applications.


  after all, there would not be 170,000,000 DOS systems in the world if
  any of the others had to be true.


  I almost added that is has to be economical, but history has actually
  proven me wrong on that.  If people added up the total cost of
  ownership, then Apple would certainly have won over the PC.  But
  people ignore the human costs of someone else (or even themselves)
  beating their head against the wall trying to get something to work,
  or the system crashing repeatedly, or the fact that the one keystroke
  they can hit the easiest (through practice) is


               <CTRL><ALT><DEL>



  In the old days people were content to spend several hundreds of dol-
  lars on a simple ASCII text editor, or deal with a simple spreadsheet.
  And it took an act of mangement to get them, with lots of Purchase
  Orders.  Today, they want multi-media integrated with their operating
  system, and have all the applications available that their neighbor
  (or boss, or compatriot) has available on their system.  And they want
  to get these applications easily, certainly no harder than to call up
  on the phone to order them through a catalog, or go down to their cor-
  ner store to get them.


  Now what causes this plethora of applications for an operating system?
  Ease of programming?  Good software development tools?  Features
  inside the operating system?  Stability of the interfaces over time?


  The answer is ``none of these''.  While all these attributes may help
  convince an application developer to port, the one overriding issue is
  volume of the operating system platform.  Again, if MSDOS were
  compared to MacOS, or even to UNIX and volume were not taken into
  account, we know which two operating systems would have the most
  applications, and they would not be from Microsoft.


  While it is true that several Linux vendors are working on getting
  these applications for the mass market (read this " your mother and
  father"), the number of applications that run on Microsoft platforms
  have been estimated as high as 35,000.  SunOS has an estimated 10,000
  applications, with other `commercial UNIX'' systems (including Solaris
  2.x) much lower in number. It will take the Linux vendors a long time
  to get the number of applications necessary to hit the really large
  mass market, particularly if they did not depend on iBCS2 and
  DOS/Windows compatibility (which could supply a fair number of current
  applications), but depended on ``native'' Linux applications.


  So applications are king (and queen) for the mass market, and
  installed base (volume) or the promise of explosive growth (volume) is
  the key to these. But is the mass market the only ``commercial''
  market?  The answer is ``no''. The mass market is a subset (albeit
  very large one) of the commercial market. So let's look at what the
  rest of the commercial market needs.  We will look at this by
  segmenting the market into:


  o  turnkey systems

  o  large end-user customers

  o  specialized markets


  5.1.  Turnkey systems


  When I speak of turnkey systems I typically mean a computer system
  that has one specific (or not so specific) application that runs on
  it.  Examples of turnkey systems are point-of-sale terminals,
  reservation systems, CAD systems, etc.  But in a larger sense, other
  applications such as Web servers, nameservers (such as BIND), etc.
  could also be considered ``turnkey'', since they have only a few
  necessary programs that have to run on the system.


  Usually turnkey systems are ones that an Independent Software Vendor
  (ISV) or Value Added Reseller (VAR) will chose a hardware system, an
  operating system, port an application to it, then duplicate that
  system 500 to 1000 times without change to the basic application.
  These ISVs and VARs will try to chose the lowest cost solution to fit
  their customer's needs.


  Linux is perfect for these types of applications.  The operating
  system is stable enough for the developer to port their application
  and test the application fully.  Once it is fully tested and stable,
  the entire package is ``frozen'' and duplicated any number of times
  for the end customer.


  Since the operating system may be freely copied, and it runs on
  inexpensive hardware, their variable costs are minimal. Even a
  developer who is not familiar with the Linux system (so they need help
  getting it running on a platform) will quickly pay back the porting
  and system programmer costs they accrue by not paying $200-$500. per
  license for the operating system.  Plus they have all the source code
  for the entire system, in case they run into trouble later on.  You
  can buy a lot of Linux support for $200-$500K.


  As I said before, I include Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as part
  of this ``turnkey'' environment, for both external internet and
  internal internet. Why overload your expensive, high-powered, highly
  complex general-purpose server to do Web serving when a smaller,
  simpler box can offload it?  Why not run your NIS slaves on a Linux
  box?  Or perhaps your BIND server?


  In the early days of Digital UNIX (known then as DEC OSF/1) we did not
  have very many applications.  In fact we had none.  The marketing
  staff came to me with sad faces asking if it was possible to sell an
  operating system that had no applications.  I invented a term called
  ``Turbocharging'', which allowed a Digital UNIX system using the speed
  and power of the Alpha processor (as well as the throughput of our
  networking devices) to offload NIS, NFS, BIND and other services from
  people's overloaded, slower SPARC machines.  We also showed people how
  they could use the rsh(1) command to allow the Alpha to do a portion
  of their very CPU intensive processing while delivering the result
  back to the SPARCs on their desk.  This allowed the SPARCs to work
  more on applications and less on the other ``system administration''
  tasks that they were performing.  We sold lots of Digital UNIX systems
  based solely on executing those tasks.  Today, of course, Digital UNIX
  has a lot more applications, and particularly very large memory
  databases that are extremely fast.  But the same principle applies.
  The database engine runs on the Alpha system, supplying data to the
  slower SPARC engines as a ``Turbocharger''.  I could see Linux systems
  headed in the same direction, following the same path.



  5.2.  Large end-user customers


  Very large customers often have their own home-grown applications
  which they need to deploy across a wide network of people.  Or they
  can have management dictate a certain suite of applications, which
  then can be ported to Linux. Since these customers are so large, their
  operating system costs are huge, and utilizing the savings using the
  Linux operating system they may completely cover the expenses of
  porting their software.


  Or these very large customers may ``influence'' their layered product
  providers to port to the Linux platform.  Finally, they may even
  change some of their computing habits (to use existing programs) if
  the cost savings are enough to warrant it.


  Companies like Caldera are creating a suite of applications and
  approaching these very large customers to show them the operating
  system savings that they can achieve if they switch to Linux.  While
  it is true that every application the customer could ever conceive of
  running may not run on Linux, by using the native applications, the
  iBCS2 applications, the DOSEMU applications, and applications that run
  under WABI, a nice suite of applications could be built to solve their
  needs.


  5.3.  Specialized markets


  Finally there are what I call ``specialized markets''.  Markets that
  might buy Linux simply because it is Linux, and not because of the
  application suites that it provides.


  In the education field there are three main markets:

  o  administrative

  o  ``campus computing''

  o  computer science education

  The administrative part is the ``business'' aspect of the market.
  They are looking for easy-to-use systems that can also handle complex
  administrative tasks that might cover a community the size of a small
  city.


  The ``campus computing'' is the supply of computing power and service
  for majors of all types, web services and research into non-computer
  science (for example, molecular modeling) research.


  Finally there is computer science education, both on the undergraduate
  and graduate level, as well as research into computer science.


  While the administrative sub-market typically relies more on shrink-
  wrapped applications, the other two rely on them to a lesser extent
  (with the computer science education market relying the least).  The
  other two markets can utilize a lot more of the freeware and shareware
  applications that are already ported to Linux.  This gives them a very
  low-cost (from a software perspective) platform while allowing them to
  see and (often) modify the source code for the applications they use.


  More importantly, in the computer science research area, the results
  of the research can be freely distributed to others working in the
  field, or even published as source code to illustrate the results.
  This can not be done with ``commercial'' operating systems.


  Some universities are utilizing Linux more and more to run their
  campus.  From a ``commercial'' standpoint, their needs are the same as
  many large businesses. Students graduating from college will know
  about Linux, and bring the word to their future employers.


  Finally, there is the computer hobbyist and software developer market.
  I relate this market to the amateur radio market.  In the amateur
  radio market the radio is often used to simply talk to other people,
  but at the same time the users investigate new ways of using radio,
  and improving it.  Many electrical engineers started out as amateur
  radio users.  So it can be with Linux, since for the first time both
  the prices of the hardware and the prices of the operating system
  source code are within the reach of mortal people.


  In conclusion, I feel that Linux does have the items needed for
  several types of ``commercial'' uses:


  o  stability and quality

  o  low variable costs for turnkey applications

  o  explosive growth in volume to attract ISVs

  What Linux really needs is for the ``commercial'' community to
  understand what is going on, and to embrace it where it will be
  useful.  This will increase the volume numbers even more, which will
  attract more applications.


  Along these lines I would like to ``advertise'' a joint effort of
  USENIX and Linux International to happen in January of 1997 in
  Anaheim, California of the United States. There will be a joint
  USENIX/Linux development conference, and while a certain part of the
  Linux conference will be oriented towards the development of the Linux
  operating system, the bulk of the conference will be oriented towards
  application developers and marketing people, to better understand the
  Linux operating system and how to sell their applications and services
  into the Linux market. We hope to show ISVs, VARs, resellers and
  distributors how they can make money by selling their applications and
  services on top of the Linux operating system.

  6.9.  ThreadTrack and WebTailor from Webthreads.



     Description:
        ThreadTrack and WebTailor are lightweight browser and server
        independent CGI script packages, developed under Linux, that add
        state to web servers.  ThreadTrack is used for tracking the
        activity of individual visitors to a web site, and WebTailor is
        used to dynamically modify the content of a web site in response
        to a visitor's profile or actions.
        WebTailor uses a simple server-side scripting language to modify
        the site's content.  The language, targeted to non-technical web
        designers, is easy to learn and use.  For the more technical,
        the CGI interface has been expanded to enable parameter passing
        on a per visitor basis between scripts running on different
        pages.

        ThreadTrack tags individual visitors to a web site with a unique
        identifier that remains with them for their visit.  Each
        visitor's session is recorded click-by-click, so a database of
        aggregate and individual activity is available for reports.
        Comprehensive reporting is included, and the data (dBase III) is
        easily transferrable to custom reporting packages.


     Distribution media:
        Internet (WWW).


     Licensing policy:
        30 Day fully functional eval available from

  9.20.  sdoc (Source Documenter)



     Description:
        This program helps to create a complete, indexed documentation
        from your sources (C, tcl, Perl currently available, other will
        follow soon).

        You add documentation information to your scripts using pod
        (Plain old documentation), the documentation format also used in
        Perl.  The documentation options provided by pod are simple and
        easy to learn but powerfull enough to create nice and good
        looking documents.

        sdoc uses this information to create a pod-document which in
        turn may be transformed to HTML, LaTeX (and PostScript), nroff
        or just plain text.

        The preview function of tdoc lets you create documentation
        interactively - add or modify your documentation to the source
        file and check the output for correctness.

        Here are some highlights:


     o  Documentation is included in source file, no separate files
        needed

     o  Powerfull formatting options combined with easy learning

     o  Good looking documentation can be created without hassle

     o  Automated indexing

     o  Output may be in HTML, PostScript and a lot of other formats
        (have a look at the perlpod manual page or at available pod
        converters).

        The Tcl Documenter is also available as a commercial version.
        This version adds the following features:


     o  Significantly faster

     o  May optionally use Netscape to display preview pages.

     o  Includes the package concept to further automate file selection.

     o  Direct connection to emacs for file editing

     o  Direct creation of postscript output

     o  Full support, upgrades

     o  Complete documentation


     Distribution media:
        3.5" diskettes and Internet (EMail and WWW).

     Licensing policy:
        You can download the public domain version of sdoc from the

  9.23.  ST/X (Smalltalk/X)



     Description:
        ST/X is a complete implementation of the Smalltalk programming
        language with development environment providing all of the
        advantages you would expect from Smalltalk: a fully object
        oriented programming language, a graphical development
        environment with editors, browsers, symbolic debugger,
        incremental compiler and just-in-time compilation to machine
        code as well as an extensive class library.


     Distribution media:
        CD-ROM.


     Licensing policy:
        There are non-commercial, evaluation and commercial licences
        available.  There is also demo version on the Internet, although
        it is quite old, this should be updated at some time in 1997.

        ST/X includes a supplementary stand-alone machine code compiler
        and the possibility to embed C code directly into Smalltalk
        methods.  This allows the exploitation and use of existing C
        libraries or a performance improvement in the speed of time
        critical operations.  An integral part of ST/X is an HTML
        browser which is fully implemented in Smalltalk.  It supports
        network loadable Smalltalk applets and smalltalk scripts
        embedded in HTML pages.  This allows the development of Internet
        and Intranet applications analogous to Java.


     Available since:
        ST/X has been available as a beta version on the Internet for
        quite a while.  eXept Software AG has been further developing
        and marketing ST/X since 1996.  Claus Gittinger (the developer
        from ST/X) is a founding member of eXept.

  9.25.  tprof (Tcl Profiler)



     Description:
        This is a profiler for tcl scripts.  It allows the creation of
        profiling data from your tcl programms and later analysis and
        detailed inspection through a graphical frontend.

        This tool is especially well suited if you encounter performance
        problems with your tcl scripts.  Instead of rewriting the whole
        application in C you can isolate time-critical procedures and
        speed them up (if necessary using C).

        Here are some highlights:

     o  Call flow display

     o  Barcharts for number of calls, CPU time and real time

     o  Tabular display of profiling data set

     o  Analyse both tcl procs and commands written in C

     o  Graphical user interface, easy use

  12.3.  Matrix<LIB> - C++ Math Matrix Library



     Description:
        Matrix<LIB> is a Matlab Compatible C++ Matrix Class Library,
        designed for development of advanced scientific high-level C++
        code.  Our main design objective was to keep the C++ source code
        clear and similar to the equivalent Matlab code, making your
        shift from Matlab to C++ easier.  If you know how to program
        Matlab, you already know how to use our Matrix<LIB> C++ Math
        Library.  The code was carefully optimized for maximal
        performance, too.  Matrix<LIB> is also included in the MATCOM V2
        distribution.

        The library includes complex math, binary and unary operators,
        powerful indexing capabilities, signal processing, file I/O,
