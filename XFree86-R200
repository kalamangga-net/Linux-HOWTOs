This HOWTO is for anyone who owns an ATI Radeon 8xxx graphics card and wants
it to function in a certain way or, in general, properly with XFree86, the X
Window System. It describes the procedure of making XFree 4.x run on an ATI
R200 (Radeon 8xxx series). There are several ways of doing this, with various
results (further described below). If you know of any other ways (maybe
better as well) of achieving the goal of this document, please let me know.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 2. System Requirements

For this HOWTO to apply to you, you'll need the following hardware/software
up and running:

Hardware

  * ATI R200 (Radeon 8xxx) based AGP card
   

Software

  * Linux kernel 2.4.x (check with uname -r)
   
  * Glibc 2.2 (check with /lib/libc.so.X where X is a decimal number)
   
  * XFree86 4.2.x for alternative 1 (check with X -version)
   
  * XFree86 4.1.x for alternatives 2, 3 and 5 (check with X -version)
   
  * XFree86 4.x for alternative 4 (check with X -version)
   

Important If you run XFree86 4.1.x/4.0.x on your computer, you can NOT use   
          alternative 1, as shown above. Of course you can try it, but it    
          won't work (or at least it didn't for me). Also, if you read [http:
          //www.xfree86.org/] The XFree86 Project's [http://www.xfree86.org/ 
          4.1.0/RELNOTES.html] release notes for XFree 4.1.x, you'll see that
          the R200 chipset is not listed as a supported chipset for the      
          radeon_drv.o driver, which means that the Radeon 8xxx is NOT       
          supported. However, if you read the [http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.0/ 
          RELNOTES.html] release notes for XFree 4.2.x, you'll see that the  
          chipset IS supported by the same driver.                           

Once you have met the system requirements, it's time to decide which of the
available alternatives to choose.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 3. The alternatives

As you could see in Chapter 2, the alternatives you can choose may be limited
by the XFree86 version you are running. It is very important that you check
the dependencies first. If you don't meet the requirements, this HOWTO will
not apply to you, and you may and probably will suffer a system crash if
proceeding.

The various alternatives of this HOWTO will give variable results. I haven't
tested every possible use of the card, but I have had a few experiences, and
the drivers also provide some information.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Experiences with XFree86's driver

This alternative is by far the simplest and safest way to set up your Radeon
if you use XFree86. The bad news is that this driver only supports 2D
(meaning DRI won't work).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2. Experiences with ATI's own driver

This alternative uses ATIs own drivers for the Linux operating system. The
drivers are developed by 3rd party Linux developers for ATI. The driver
supports some 3D acceleration, and works almost "out of the box".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3. Experiences with DRI's driver

This alternative seemed like a good idea after running tired on the DRI
problems with both previous driver alternatives. DRI is the 3D part of
XFree86, and is an independent project, releasing it's own drivers. XFree86
has DRI implemented, but the drivers aren't the same. In fact, DRI has
developed their own driver specifically for the R200 chipset, meaning it is a
driver that supports 3D and works fine with X. Still, the driver supports
hardly any of the later GL extensions, meaning more recent games like UT2003
won't run with it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4. Experiences with the GATOS project's driver

This alternative is a 3rd party alternative, meaning it can result in a much
more unstable (and possibly damaged) system. I found this alternative to work
rather well. The 3D support was equivalent with that of DRI (at least when I
tried it), meaning this and the DRI alternative are almost equivalent.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.5. Thoughts on Schneider Digital's driver

This alternative is another 3rd party alternative, but this one's rather
good. [http://www.schneider-digital.de/] Schneider Digital provides drivers
for various cards, among them [http://www.schneider-digital.de/html/
download_ati.html] ATI R200/R300. The drivers are made for XFree 4.1+, and
seem rather well developed. Note though that I haven't yet tried these
drivers myself, but I still thinkt they look like a very decent alternative.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.6. Still Haven't Chosen One?

I'd recommend you to use the DRI driver. I've had great experiences with this
driver, although its GL support is somewhat narrow. If a more worthy 3D
system is what you want, I'd recommend you to make the upgrades necesseary
and go for Schneider Digitals driver or XFree86's own driver, but please give
me some feedback if you do.

Now that you've been given the information you need to choose a driver,
choose one and move on!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 4. Step-by-step instructions

4.1. Alternative 1: Using XFree86's Radeon driver

This alternative requires XFree 4.2 or later, and the installation or upgrade
to this version is beyond the scope of this HOWTO (visit [http://
www.xfree86.org/] The XFree86 Project for further information on how to
upgrade or install XFree86). When XFree is installed and/or upgraded to the
correct version, all you need to do is configure it. There are two ways of
doing this that apply to all Linux distributions. You can either run 
xf86onfig, which is XFree86's own text-based configuration tool, or you can
edit the configuration file by hand. Keep in mind that this HOWTO only
describes how to configure the Radeon card, and XFree86 needs a lot more
configuration than that to work.

If you choose to run xf86config, you will sooner or later come to the
question, "Do you want to look at the card database? (y/n)". Answer y (yes),
and press ENTER. Choose one of the cards that use the ati driver by keying in
the number to its left and then pressing ENTER. Which card you choose does
not matter, as long as you choose a card that runs the ati driver. You will
then be asked to give an identifier string for your card. You can type
anything you want, but I recommend you type something descriptive, such as 
"Radeon card". Finish the configuration process.

If you want to edit the configuration file manually, locate it (usually /etc/
X11/XF86Config), and open it in your favorite editor. Find the place that
says Section "Device". In this section, there should be a line saying Driver
"somedrivername". Edit this line so it says Driver "ati". Comment out all
other lines in the Device section (add a # in front of them). Your device
section should now look like this:
Section "Driver"                                                                  
Identifier "some_identifier" (the identifier is your choice, but if you edit it,  
make sure you update  every reference to it in the config file).                  
Driver "ati"                                                                      
                                                                                  
# ...                                                                             
# ...                                                                             

You are now ready to run!

Configure the rest of XFree86, and you're ready to run!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2. Alternative 2: Using ATI's own R200 Driver

ATI's R200 driver comes in three distributions - one for XFree4.1, one for
XFree4.2 and one for XFree4.3. You can download ATIs driver from [http://
mirror.ati.com/support/drivers/linux/radeon-linux.html] here. Sadly, for
those of us who do not use a RedHat-based or other RPM-supporting
distribution, the package is only available in RPM format. For those of us
who do not have RPM support, alien is the program to use. Alien converts
between various package formats. To convert the ATI driver package to a .deb
package, use alien --to-deb packagename.rpm. To convert it to a .tgz package,
use alien --to-tgz packagename.rpm.

You are now ready to install the driver. To install it, use:

  * rpm -i --force /path/to/packagename.rpm, if you are installing the rpm
    package
   
  * dpkg -i --force-overwrite /path/to/packagename.deb, if you made a .deb
    package
   
  * cd / && tar zxvf /path/to/packagename.tgz, if you made a .tgz package.
   

You are now ready to configure the driver. To install it, issue the following
commands as root:
cd /lib/modules/fglr200/build_mod/                                           
./make.sh                                                                    
cd /lib/modules/fglr200/                                                     
./make_install.sh                                                            

The driver is now ready for use.

Important The driver will not load unless you tell your Linux system to load 
          it every time at startup. To do this, you must find out where to   
          tell your Linux which modules to load at startup. In Debian, you   
          must add the followng line to /etc/modules:                        
          fglr200                                                            
                                                                             
          Add the line to the end of the file. You are now ready to configure
          XFree86.                                                           

XFree86 can be configured in two ways: either by running fglrxconfig
(supplied by the ATI driver), or by editing the XF86Config file manually.

If you choose to run fglrxconfig, the process is similar to a regular 
xf86config run, except for the choice of which screen card driver to use
(which will automatically be set to the ATI Radeon driver).

If you want to edit the configuration file manually, locate it (usually /etc/
X11/XF86Config), and open it in your favorite editor. Find the place saying
Section "Device". In this section, there should be a line saying Driver
"somedrivername". Edit this line so it says Driver "fglr200" and add the
following lines right below that line:
Option "no_accel" "no"                                                       
Option "no_dri" "no"                                                         
Option "overlay" "off"                                                       

Comment out all other lines in the Device section (add a # in front of them).
Your device section should now look like this:
Section "Driver"                                                                  
Identifier "some_identifier" (the identifier is your choice, but if you edit it,  
make sure you update every reference to it in the config file).                   
Driver "fglr200"                                                                  
Option "no_accel" "no"                                                            
Option "no_dri" "no"                                                              
Option "overlay" "no"                                                             
                                                                                  
# ...                                                                             
# ...                                                                             
                                                                                  

You are now ready to run!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3. Alternative 3: Using DRI's Latest Radeon Driver

The first thing you must do is to download the driver. You can download it
from [http://dri.sourceforge.net/download.phtml] here (make sure you download
the r200-XXXXXXXX-i386.tar.bz2 package). After you have downloaded the
driver, go to the directory you saved it in and type tar jxvf
packagename.tar.bz2. Go to the new directory, (cd dripkg/), and type ./
install.sh. This will install the driver for you. You are now ready to
configure XFree86, either by running xf86config or by editing the config file
manually. The configuration process is exactly the same as in Section 4.1, so
just follow the configuration steps there.

You are now ready to run XFree86!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.4. Alternative 4: Using the GATOS Project's Latest Driver

The GATOS project is an independent developer team. They develop drivers and
utilities for ATI cards. To install their driver with DRI-support, you need
to download it from [http://gatos.sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?
group_id=12629] here. Download the ati.2 file for your appropriate XFree86
version. You also need a set of files to enable dri support. These files are
called the drm-kernel module. They can only be downloaded from CVS. To
download them, issue the following commands:
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gatos.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gatos login             
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gatos.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gatos co drm-kernel 

You are now ready to install the driver. Type the following commands to
install it:
cd drm-kernel/                                                               
make -f Makefile.linux                                                       
cp radeon.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/video/gatosdrm.o          
modprobe gatosdrm                                                            

You now need to make Linux load the module gatosdrm each time at startup. To
do this, find out where your Linux distribution keeps the list of modules to
load at startup and add the line gatosdrm to the end of that file (in Debian,
the file is /etc/modules).

You are now ready to install the GATOS driver for the Radeon card. To do so,
type the following commands:
cd /usr                                                                      
tar zxvf /path/to/name-of-ati.2-package.tar.gz                               

The driver is now installed.

You are now ready to configure XFree86. This can be done by running 
xf86config, or by editing the XFree86 configuration file manually. The
configuration process is the same as for XFree86's own driver in Section 4.1,
so go back to that point and follow the XFree86 configuration process
described there.

You are now ready to run XFree86!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.5. Alternative 5: Using Schneider Digital's drivers

Schneider Digital's driver is the one driver I haven't tried myself, but it
seems like a serious attempt on making a decent ATI Radeon driver for Linux.
Well, enough chatting, let's get down to business.

 First, download the driver file for either [http://www.schneider-digital.de/
download/ati/glx1_linux_X4.1.zip] XFree86 4.1.x, [http://
www.schneider-digital.de/download/ati/glx1_linux_X4.2.zip] XFree86 4.2.x or
[http://www.schneider-digital.de/download/ati/glx1_linux_X4.3.zip] XFree86
4.3.x..

The installation instructions for this driver are exactly the same as for 
Section 4.2, so follow those.

Congratulations, you are now up and running! Please let me know about your
experiences with this driver, as I didn't try it myself.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.
But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any
textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose
is instruction or reference.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.2. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms
of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.
Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could
be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related
matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political
position regarding them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup
has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers
is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for
human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary
formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.3. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced
in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of
this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
publicly display copies.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.4. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.
Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of
these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of
the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the
covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as
they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be
treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general
network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using
public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must
take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies
in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible
at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you
distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of
that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.5. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:

 A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,
    if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You
    may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
    that version gives permission.
   
 B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
    of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
   
 C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
    Version, as the publisher.
   
 D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   
 E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
    the other copyright notices.
   
 F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
    the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
    License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
   
 G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
    required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
   
 H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   
 I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an
    item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
    Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
    entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
    authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
    add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
    sentence.
   
 J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
    These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
    location for a work that was published at least four years before the
    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
    gives permission.
   
 K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the
    section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone
    of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
    therein.
   
 L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
    considered part of the section titles.
   
 M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
    included in the Modified Version.
   
 N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in
    title with any Invariant Section.
   

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and
one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.6. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make
the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the
various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise
combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled
"Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.7. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
regarding verbatim copying of that document.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.8. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the
Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation.
Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply
to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account
of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of
the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround
only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers
around the whole aggregate.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.9. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include
the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this License, the
original English version will prevail.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.10. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.11. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns. See [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/] http://
www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.12. How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices
just after the title page:

   
      Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute
    and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation
    License, Version 1.1 or any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation; with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A
    copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
    Documentation License".
   
If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections" instead
of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write
"no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise
for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free
software.
