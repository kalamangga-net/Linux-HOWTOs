  1.  Introduction

  VMailMgr (short for Virtual MAIL ManaGeR) is a package of programs
  designed to manage multiple domains of mail addresses and mailboxes on
  a single host. It co-operates with qmail for mail delivery and program
  control.

  1.1.  What is VMailMgr and why should I use it?

  VMailMgr is:

  A series of utilities for managing virtual domains which include a
  password checking interface for qmail which replaces the usual
  checkpassword, and an authentication module for Courier IMAP, that
  provide access to the virtual mailboxes by one of three methods:

  ·  IP-based virtual server access (invisible to the POP3 user)

  ·  username-based access (username-virtualuser)

  ·  hostname-based access (virtualuser@virtual.host or
     virtualuser:virtual.host)

  You should use it if:

  You prefer to have each domain controlled by a seperate username,
  allowing the use of system quotas and better security

  1.2.  New versions

  1.7.  Acknowledgements and Thanks

  Thanks to Bruce Guenter for VMailMgr and the core of this HOWTO.
  Thanks to Mike Bell, who always seems to have the answers to my
  questions. Finally, thanks to all those on the vmailmgr@lists.em.ca
  <mailto:vmailmgr@lists.em.ca> mailing list who have helped me, or
  asked the same stuff so many times that I had to write this to stop
  the repeat questions.

  2.  Installation

  2.1.  Visit the VMailMgr websiteurlnam
  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/vmailmgr/> to get the package.  Get the files

  If you get the binary RPMS you will need at least the vmailmgr and
  vmailmgr-daemon packages.

  2.2.  Install with RPMS

  2.2.1.  Compiling SRC.RPM's

  Simply compile the src.rpm file with the `rpm --rebuild` command.
  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    rpm -ivh vmailmgr-0.96.6-1.src.rpm
  ______________________________________________________________________



  2.2.2.  Installing RPM's

  After compiling the source rpms, the binaries will be located in
  `/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/` or something similar.

  Simply run the following command for each package

    rpm -ivh <location>/<package.i386.rpm>


  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/vmailmgr-0.96.6-1.i386.rpm
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/VMailMgr-daemon-0.96.6-1.i386.rpm
  ______________________________________________________________________



  2.3.  Install with source

  If you dont ue RPMS you can install from source.

  Run the following command

    (As non-root user)
    tar zxf <package.tar.gz>
    cd <newly created dir>
    ./configure
    make
    (As root)
    make install


  -Example-



  ______________________________________________________________________
    (As non-root user)
    tar zxf vmailmgr-0.96.6.tar.gz
    cd vmailmgr-0.96.6
    ./configure
    make
    (As root)
    make install
  ______________________________________________________________________


  That should do it.

  3.  Setup

  3.1.  Setting Up a Virtual Domain

  The following steps are necessary to set up a virtual domain with
  vmailmgr (assuming vmailmgr has been compiled and installed). As an
  example, we'll set up a virtual user `me@mydomain.org`, with aliases
  of `myself@mydomain.org` and `myname@mydomain.org`.

  1. Set up a DNS entry for the domain. I won't cover this here, as it
     is dependant on far too many other things.  I will mention that to
     make IP based virtual domains work a PTR record which matches an
     entry in virtualdomains is nessesary, for example, if nslookup
     10.56.33.122 returns mail.mydomain.com, `virtualdomains` needs an
     entry like `mail.mydomain.com:myuser`

     For the example, we'll assume that the mail exchanger for
     mydomain.org is already set up to point to your computer.

  2. Set up a base user for the domain. Create a user, with a name of
     your choosing.  Since the maildirs for all the users in the virtual
     domain will be stored under this user's home directory, make sure
     you set the user up in a partition or disk that is appropriate for
     such storage. The tools that you should use to accomplish this step
     vary greatly between different systems. For our example, I'll add a
     user `myuser`.

  3. Configure qmail to recognize the domain. To do this, you need to
     modify two of qmail's configuration files in `/var/qmail/control`
     `rcpthosts` and `virtualdomains`.

  ·  To `rcpthosts` : add the line `mydomain.org`.

  ·  To `virtualdomains` : add the line `mydomain.org:myuser`.

     If you wish to have mail to `anything.mydomain.org` be delivered in
     the same way, add the following

  ·  To `rcpthosts` : add the line `.mydomain.org`.

  ·  To `virtualdomains` : add the line `.mydomain.org:myuser`.

  4. Configure qmail-popup/qmail-pop3d to use `checkvpw` as the password
     checker. This step is dependant on how you have installed qmail.

  ·  Replace `checkpassword` in the command you use to invoke qmail-
     popup/qmail-pop3d (either in `/etc/inet.conf` or in a `tcpserver`
     command) with `checkvpw`.

  ·  And/Or at the prompt type: `echo checkvpw >
     /var/qmail/control/checkpassword`


  5. Add users or aliases to the domain. Either change user to the user
     you just created (for example, type `su - myuser`) or log in (with
     either telnet or at the console) as the new user, and use the
     included programs to add users and aliases.

     For our example, we would

  ·  type: `vadduser me` (which prompts for a password)

  ·  type: `vaddalias me myself`

  ·  and type: `vaddalias me myname`

     After you have completed all these steps, you will need to kill and
     restart `qmail-send` to make it read the new `virtualdomains`
     table.

  If you are using `inetd` to launch `qmail-popup`, `kill -HUP` the
  `inetd` process as well.

  3.2.  Using one IP address for mutiple domains

  3.2.1.  Logging in as a virtual user?

  There are two ways to log in without using multiple IP addresses.


  1. The first way is to log in as `userSEPvirtual.domain.org`, where
     `user` is the mailbox name of the virtual user, SEP is one of `@`
     or `:` (by default, this is configurable in the `/etc/vmailmgr/'
     directory), and `virtual.domain.org' is the virtual domain's name,
     as listed in `/var/qmail/control/virtualdomains'.

  2. The second way is to use the internal form of the mailbox name --
     that is, `baseuser-user', where `user' is the same as above, and
     `baseuser' is the username of the managing user.

     Example: `/var/qmail/control/virtualdomains' contains

       testdomain.org:testuser


  User `myuser' exists, and has set up a virtual mailbox with the name
  `me'. The `separators' variable in `/etc/vmailmgr/' contains `@:'.
  This virtual user could log in as `me@mydomain.com', `me:mydomain.cm',
  or `myuser-me'.


  3.3.  Catch all misdirected mail?

  In the `vmailmgr/' configuration directory, there is an entry called
  `default-username'. If mail to a virtual domain does not match any
  users or aliases in that domain, it is delivered to the name listed in
  this configuration item if it exists (which defaults to `+'). To make
  this deliver to you, simply type:

    vaddalias me +



  3.4.  Setup VMailMgr IMAP support?

  VMailMgr supports Courier-IMAP, but Courier-IMAP does not auto detect
  VMailMgr.  This means that some minor work is required for making the
  two work together.

  ·  You must copy `/usr/local/bin/authvmailmgr` to `/usr/lib/courier-
     imap/libexec/authlib/authvmailmgr`.

  ·  Then modify the `AUTHMODULES` statement in `/usr/lib/courier-
     imap/etc/imapd.config` and add `authvmailmgr` as the first
     authentication module.
