  2.  What is WordPerfect

  WordPerfect is a popular, fully-featured commercial word processor
  program that is available for multiple platforms including Linux.  It
  was originally written and sold by WordPerfect Corporation,
  subsequently purchased by Novell, then purchased about a year or so
  ago by Corel Corporation (Ottawa, Ontario, CA).  Corel has outsourced
  the development of WordPerfect for UNIX (including Linux) to SDC
  Corporation, a corporation including former WordPerfect developers,
  and specializing in development for UNIX and X windows.


  Until the release of Microsoft Word, WordPerfect was the most popular
  word processor for personal computers (it still claims to be by volume
  of product shipped, some reports indicate that more copies were sold
  than Microsoft Word during recent months). WordPerfect was originally
  written for DOS and later ported to the UNIX and Windows environments.
  Initial versions of WordPerfect for Windows were very late to market
  and tended to crash a lot, hence opening the floodGATES for Microsoft
  Word.  WordPerfect is still a better word processor than Word for
  large documents or documents that must be moved between Mac, UNIX, and
  Microsoft platforms.


  WordPerfect provides a WYSWYG environment for editing text documents.
  One of the best features is the ability to check your spelling as you
  type.  Included are grammar checker, spelling checker, graphics import
  and export, and the ability to edit HTML documents.  Documents created
  by WordPerfect on one platform may be read, edited, and printed on
  other platforms (I have generated a lot of documents using WP 6.0
  (Caldera's release) and distributed them to Windows 95 users using WP
  7.0 or 8.0).


  WordPerfect runs on the following platforms (release or beta
  versions):

    Linux 1.2.13 (WordPerfect 6.0 for Linux, sold by Caldera)

    Linux 2.0.X (WordPerfect 6.0 and WordPerfect 7.0)

    Microsoft DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows NT

    Macintosh

    HP-UX 10.01

    IBM AIX 4.1.4

    SCO OpenServer 5.0.0

    Sun SPARC Solaris 2.5

    SUN SPARC SunOS 4.1.x

    SUN X86 Solaris 2.5.1

    Digital UNIX 3.2 G Alpha

    SCO 3.2.4.2



  3.  WordPerfect 7.0 Beta


  3.1.  Impressions of 7.0

  I have been very impressed with the operation of WordPerfect 7.0 for
  Linux.  I only recently downloaded it and tried it.  It looks like WP
  7.0 for Windows.  The features appear to work properly.  I especially
  like the spell-as-you-go feature!

  The HTML publisher works a little better than that on WP 6.0, but
  still has some bugs.  Someone reported that WP 7.0 requires a lot of
  swap space (I have not tested it at this time).


  3.2.  Getting WordPerfect 7.0

  WP 7.0 is available as several LARGE tarballs from sdcorp's FTP site
  (or via the WWW).  I tried for two days to download the 26MB archive
  using ISDN but only was able to get part of the file.  I eventually
  had to use a commercial account with a T1 to the Internet to get the
  files.  It would be much easier to download if each tarball was split
  into several smaller files (1-2 MB in size).  Note, when you
  uncompress the tarballs, the result is a small number of medium sized
  files -- just what is needed.

  The current version that you can download is time limited to 15 days.
  During this time, you can pay them and they will give you a license
  for it.



     For WP 7.0 Beta:

          ftp://ftp.sdcorp.com/pub/linux_betab/wp7linuxbetab.tar.gz

                4887525 graphics_tar.gz
               17652138 manual_tar.gz
                 450535 wp60ms01_us.all
                 290443 wp60ps01_us.all
               26962514 wp7linuxbetab_tar.gz



  3.3.  Installation of 7.0

  To install, you must extract the tarballs, run the Runme program,
  answer some questions and then run xwp to start WP 7.0.  Note, you
  need 58 MB just for WP 7.0, prior to the manuals, graphics, etc.


  1. Extract the tarball into a temporary directory, need 31M

                   tar xvzf wp7linuxbetab_tar.gz
                     creates LINUX* files and Runme, the install program



  2. As root and with X windows running, run the Runme program and you
     get a series of screens to select the installation type.  Answer
     the questions:

  3. Run xwp:

                     /opt/wp7.0/wpbin/xwp& (or wherever you installed it)



  Note, I have WP 6.0 from Caldera, the first time I started, I got a
  prompt to load defaults from 6.0.  I selected YES and WP loaded the
  defaults and exited.  I then restarted xwp and my defaults, including
  the last files I edited with WP 6.0 were used!



  3.4.  Features


    WordPerfect word processor

    Internet publisher

    QuickCorrect - fix your typos while typing

    Spell-As-You-Go - spell checking while typing

    File compatibility with DOS, UNIX, and other WordPerfect versions
     on other platforms


  3.5.  Bugs in 7.0


    HTML export of a WP document with headers and footers sometimes
     leaves the bottom of the document either centered or bold.

    HTML export of a WP document with a table of contents does not
     generate cross references.

    HTML export messes up the table of contents and if sections were
     outlined, they become HTML list items and no longer match the TOC.

    Installation of the manual failed.  I have not had time to try to
     fix this problem.

    Someone reported a problem converting WPG graphics to JPG.

    WP 7.0 can not read files from Office97 (this has been a major pain
     for me as I have received several such files from others and I do
     not have Office97).

    Someone reported a possible problem with getting printing to work
     (I had no problems at all).

    Upon starting xwp, I received a message that some backup files
     existed.  Upon clicking on the first backup file, XWP dumped core.


  3.6.  Pricing and Availability

  Upgrade pricing expected to be $149.99 (US) and retail pricing
  $199.99.


  4.  WordPerfect 6.0 (Caldera)

  Caldera sells both a WordPerfect and Motif Bundle ($130 US) and the
  Caldera Internet Office Suite ($219 US).  Both include WordPerfect 6.0
  for Linux.

  Overall, WP 6.0 has been good to me.  I have generated 20-30 large
  documents and numerous small ones, probably 1000+ pages if I printed
  them all out.  The only problem that I have is that I use WP Times
  font under Linux and it is not compatible with the WP True Type Times
  font under Windows.


  4.1.  Impressions of 6.0

  The author has been using WordPerfect for Linux on Caldera Network
  Desktop (CND) for the past year.  The system is a P6/200, 64M RAM,
  SCSI, CND 1.0 with RiskyHack patches to the Linux 2.0.30 kernel,
  updated RPM, and many, many RPMS from Redhat and Caldera's WWW sites.



  4.2.  Getting WordPerfect 6.0

  Visit Caldera's WWW site at http://www.caldera.com
  <http://www.caldera.com>



  4.3.  Installation of 6.0

  Installation was easy. I just followed the directions provided....

  I did have to add wp to my fvwm menu (I am using FVWM95 on CND 1.0
  with lots of patches) and to looking glass's menus.

  My platform is a P6/200, 64M RAM, Caldera CND 1.0, RiskyHacks to libc
  5.4.4, kernel 2.0.30 (Joliet and FAT32 patches), dual SCSI, CD-R, etc.
  WP uses 74 MB of disk space.


  4.4.  Bugs in 6.0


    Export to HTML has several bugs with complex documents requiring
     some reformatting.

    Occasional crashes (very rare).

    Occasionally WP loops where it uses all memory and runs out of swap
     space, then crashes.

    Some fonts are different between Windows and UNIX versions.

    It has been reported to me that some WP macros for UNIX versions
     are different than those for Windows versions.



  5.  WordPerfect 5.1 and 6.0 (SCO release)

  I started using WP 5.1 for SCO (which was statically linked) since
  January, 1995. In the Spring, 1995, I obtained a copy of WP 6.0 for
  SCO (dynamic linked) and was able to install it with some pain. I
  subsequently have had some problems with the license manager. I have
  it running under 1.2.8.
  This section is mainly from the original WordPerfect mini-howto.  It
  has not been used in a long time.  Note, the more recent versions of
  WP for SCO included both the dynamic and static linked versions, and
  hence did NOT require SCO's shared libraries.

  This is mainly for background information!  If you really want WP for
  Linux, get the new WP 7.0!


  5.1.  Impressions of WP/SCO

  WP for SCO seemed to work fine (once the installation problems were
  overcome).  I used this distribution for about 6-12 months until I
  received a copy of WP 6.0 for Linux (Caldera) and CND 1.0.



  5.2.  Getting WordPerfect WP/SCO

  Contact SCO or visit their WWW page at http://www.sco.com
  <http://www.sco.com>



  5.3.  Installation of WP/SCO



  5.3.1.  Requirements



    Linux 1.1.x to 1.2.x

    modules (dynamic module loading software)

    iBCS2 (Intel BCS2 and ELF loader module)

    SCO dynamic libs (if required)

    Domainname should be setup

    Hostname should be setup and be less than 8 characters (localhost
     is 9)


  5.3.2.  Kernel Requirements

  The kernel should be setup for module support and ELF support. If you
  have already done this, skip this step, else, do the following as
  root:


    Load kernel in /usr/src/linux.xxx] and make sure that the symbolic
     link to the /usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm directories are
     setup (see /usr/src/linux/README).

    Build module support and install it (see below)

    Build iBCS2 module and install it (see below)

    Build kernel with module and ELF support (answer Y to BINFMTELF and
     MODVERSIONS)

    Reboot on new kernel

    Note: you have to build the module support file "genksyms" PRIOR to
     making your new kernel (telling the kernel to export symbols:
     CONFIGMODVERSIONS=y).


  5.3.3.  Modules


  Loadable module support is required for iBCS2 and hence to run WP 6.0.
  Get the latest from the ftp sites, build it, and install it. If you
  have already setup your system for loadable modules, skip this step.
  Loadable module support (/sbin/insmod, /sbin/rmmod, /sbin/lsmod) is
  required. With recent kernels, genksyms is also required.


    File: modules-1.1.87.tar.gz (or latest)

    Put tar file in /usr/src/modules and build module support

    Read the README in /usr/src/modules (or wherever you put it)

    Cd to /usr/src/modules/genksyms and make genksysms, install it in
     /usr/local/bin (or /sbin)


  5.3.4.  iBCS2 Emulator

  The iBCS2 emulator allows you to run SCO binaries such as WordPerfect
  6.0. Get the latest from the ftp sites, build it, and install it.


    Build and install in /usr/lib/modules

    Read the HINTS file (/usr/src/ibcs/Doc/HINTS)

    Make sure that iBCS2 sets up /dev/XOR, if not, create a symbolic
     link from /dev/null to /dev/XOR (cd /dev; ln -s /dev/null /dev/XOR)

  The interfaces to some subsystems occur at the device layer and thus
  you need to create some device files in order to use them:



          * /dev/socksys and /dev/nfsd - interface for SVr3 STREAMS based
            TCP/IP applications

            # mknod /dev/socksys c 30 0
            # ln -s /dev/socksys /dev/nfsd

          [WARNING:  the below may already be setup as /dev/inet,
           /dev/arp, etc., they may have other major/minor numbers,
           if so, skip this step]

          * /dev/inet/{arp,icmp,ip,rip,tcp,udp} - more network hooks

            # mknod /dev/inet/arp c 30 2
            # mknod /dev/inet/icmp c 30 2
            # mknod /dev/inet/ip c 30 2
            # mknod /dev/inet/rip c 30 2
            # mknod /dev/inet/tcp c 30 2
            # mknod /dev/inet/udp c 30 2

          [THIS IS REQUIRED AND WILL USUALLY HAVE TO BE DONE MANUALLY!]
          * /dev/X0R - server side of SVR3 local X interface
            (see comments in Doc/Local-X)

            # ln -s /dev/null /dev/X0R

          * /dev/spx - client side of SVR3 local X interface
            (see comments in Doc/Local-X)

            # mknod /dev/spx c 30 1



  5.3.5.  SCO Shared Libraries


  DO NOT VIOLATE SCO's COPYRIGHTS! You should get a copy of SCO's shared
  libraries and install them in /shlib. As root:


    cd /; mkdev /shlib; chmod 755 /shlib

    if required, make a temporary directory and set TMPDIR to it
     (export TMPDIR=/mytmpdir)

    Copy the following SCO shared libraries from the SCO machine to
     Linux and put in /shlib:

              /shlib/libX11R5_s
              /shlib/libXtXm*



  5.3.6.  Loading WP60


  Make sure that you have LOTS of space in your /tmp directory. If you
  do not have lots of space, make a tmp directory and set the
  environment variable TMPDIR to it.  As root first try the following:


    Mount the CD (e.g., to /cdrom)

    cd to the CDROM and run the ./install script

  If you get the following error you may not have enough space in your
  /tmp directory, make a new tmp directory and set the environment
  variable TMPDIR (see above):


    ERROR:  not enough space in /tmp, or this is an unsupported machine.



  If all else fails, you may have to do it manually per these notes:


    get iBCS2 running

    copy the $WPDIR/cdrom/install.wp to $WPDIR and edit it I changed it
     so I could create /tmp/WpTmP on an NFS server (did not have the
     space locally). I then ran the program and made changes until I got
     it to startup.]

    change to TMPDIR and run: ifiles/cdlink.sco -r
     /usr/local/wp60/cdrom This builds links with the proper names but
     the permissions are not set properly.

    make a temp directory on the server and copy all files to it:

             cp -r  WpTmP/wp60/SCO/* wp60



    change to the temp wp60 directory and changed permissions. cd wp60;
     chmod 555 wpinstall install/*

    run the wpinstall program and answered the questions.

    Because I still have the flexlm license manager for WP51 on the
     system, I had to manually run wplicense -e and create a new
     license.dat.

    Start WP60.


  5.3.7.  License Manager

  WordPerfect uses a license manager (see the manuals). This is a tricky
  beast that sometimes does not work properly under Linux (I have had it
  fail, done something else then I was able to start it). If you have
  problems call WordPerfect and they can assist you. Please RTFM the
  documentation section on the license manager.


  To start the license manager, as root:


          # cd $WPDIR/shbin10
          # ./wplicense -s



  5.3.8.  Starting WP60


    start iBCS2

    start the license manager

    setup your DISPLAY environment variable (e.g., export
     DISPLAY=gator:0)

    run xwp ($WPDIR/wpbin/xwp filename.wpf &)

  If you get the errors:


    /dev/XOR: No such file or directory
    Error: Can't open display: :0.0



  You need to set up your DISPLAY environment variable (per above) and
  possibly setup the link to the device /dev/XOR (cd /dev; ln -s
  /dev/null /dev/XOR).

  Note if WP "steals" the colors from your X server (a problem if the
  depth is only 256 colors), disable the display of the graphics banner
  page by doing the following:

    Start XWP

    From the control window, click on Preferences

    from the Preferences window, select ENVIRONMENT

    From the ENVIRONMENT window, turn off the checkbox for "Graphical
     Banner and Startup Screen"


  5.3.9.  RC Scripts

  You will need to add a line to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local script (or
  similar) to start iBCS2 and the WP license manager (if desired).


          # /sbin/insmod /usr/lib/modules/iBCS &
          # $WPDIR/shbin10/wplicense -s &



  5.3.10.  Changes to install

  This was extracted from my original notes and includes changes to
  install.wp that are reported to work:

  The install.wp on the CDROM did not work out of the box. I had to
  modify it to get it to work by moving all files to a temporary
  directory and changing this install script.  The changes are:

  5.4.  Bugs in WP/SCO

  I did not keep a detailed list of bugs for WP/SCO, however:

    The initial version had install problems.

    The initial version used SCO shared libraries, hence required a
     copy of them on Linux.


  6.  The Future

  Sometime in August, WordPerfect 7.0 for Linux should ship.  It should
  be available from SDC <http://www.sdcorp.com/wpunix.html> for about
  $149.99 for a competitive upgrade or $199.99 retail.


  Corel is working on porting their entire office suite to Java and
  releasing it as Corel Office for Java(TM).  This currently is in Beta
  and works on Linux (I tried the first beta -- very slow).  Check out
  http://officeforjava.corel.com/about.htm
  <http://officeforjava.corel.com/about.htm> for more information.  This
  promises to be something to watch.


  SDC is currently working on WPLinux 8 with an expected beta mid 1998
  and a release following by about 5 months.  SDC has indicated that if
  there is not sufficient demand for WP for Linux, they will probably
  not ship it (they already stopped shipping for SGI and UNIXWare) -- so
  if you like it, buy it!


  7.  For More Information

  Software Development Corporation is the developer of WordPerfect for
  UNIX.  Corel has outsourced the development of WordPerfect for UNIX to
  SDC.  I have been in touch with the SDC product manager for WP for
  LINUX and he has been very helpful (I have provided him with a review
  copy of this document).
