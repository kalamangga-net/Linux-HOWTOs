  1.  Introduction

  Linux is a fascinating operating system because it lets any user
  participate in its development. The variety of available languages,
  however, can be confusing to beginning Linux developers. This document
  lists the most common options for everyday development and states some
  key facts about them. (Well, ``most common'' and ``key'' as I perceive
  them.)

  My aim is neither to review the languages nor to determine which one
  is the best.  Each language is a tool that fits some jobs and some
  tastes. You can get further (often conflicting) information easily, if
  you ask around or keep your ears open. The Links sections in this
  document will give you some pointers for your own research.

  There is a plethora of languages and libraries for Linux, so this
  document only covers the most common languages and GUI (Graphical User
  Interface) toolkits at the moment. This document is intended to be
  fairly neutral, but I haven't included all languages available. Since
  my judgment is undoubtedly biased in many ways, I advise serious
  developers to check out the sites that do a better job in listing all
  languages and libraries. Also note that only the Linux implementations
  of the languages and GUI toolkits are covered, their features on other
  platforms are not discussed or implied.

  This document is a recent addition to the LDP, so there has not been
  opportunity for much community feedback. However, it is released in
  hopes that it will prove useful for people interested in programming
  under Linux, especially beginners. A question mark in the tables
  indicates lack of information. If you can fill it in, please contact
  the author.

  1.6.  Credits

  I am thankful to several people who commented on language issues.
  These conversations have given me a better view of the different
  languages, and I hope future conversations will allow this mini-HOWTO
  to mature over time. Especially I would like to thank the people at
  the IRCNet channel #linux: Morphy, Bluesmurf, Vadim, Zonk^, Rikkus and
  others whose names I have forgotten. Thanks go also to Stig Erik
  Sandoe for helpful comments.

  2.  Programming Languages

  C, Lisp and Perl are traditional hacking languages in the GNU/Linux
  culture; Python, PHP, Java and C++ have gained new ground recently.

  2.1.  Concepts in the Table



     Language
        A common name of the language.


     Beginner
        Indicates how well suited the language is for people with little
        programming experience. A language marked with ``yes'' should be
        viable for a beginner's first programming language.


     Performance
        How fast your applications are likely to run when you put them
        into production use.  Performance depends more on your
        algorithmic programming skills than the actual language.  As a
        rule of thumb, C, C++ and Fortran are sometimes necessary
        because they can offer better performance than other languages -
        at other times they might be unwieldy for the desired purpose.
        (One idea for unscientific ``benchmarking'' of the languages
        would be to implement a simple sorting algorithm in all of them
        and compare running times. This of course does not measure the
        performance of the actual language - since that concept does not
        make sense - but only the implementation. Of course it's also
        not a very reliable or thorough method, but it would give an
        example how running times in different languages can differ.
        Anybody want to help me with this?)


     OOP, Object-Oriented Programming vs. other paradigms
        Object-oriented programming is an important programming paradigm
        that is gaining popularity.  In object oriented programming,
        data structures and algorithms are integrated into units, often
        called classes. OOP is often contrasted with procedural
        programming (which uses separate algorithms and data
        structures).  It is not strictly dependent on language: you can
        do OOP in languages not listed as such (C for example), and
        program in the procedural style in languages that are listed as
        OOP.  I've listed as OOP languages that have special features or
        add-ons to facilitate OOP.  Functional languages (Lisp for
        example) are a bit different breed - among other things,
        functional programming is a superset of OOP. Logic programming
        (Prolog), also called declarative programming, on the other
        hand, is not related to the other types of programming in a
        similar sense.


     RAD, Rapid Application Development
        More dependent on the tools you are using than the actual
        language.  There is a HOWTO on GUI development tools for Linux,
        although it's out of date.  With a good graphical tool you can
        do RAD. RAD can be powerful when based on code reuse as well, so
        free software could provide a good starting point.


     Examples
        Mentions fields of programming the language is most often used
        in. Other good (and bad) uses exist, but they are less typical.



     Comments
        Additional information on the language, like capacities and
        dialects.

  2.3.  Shell Programming

  Shells are an important programming environment, too. I haven't
  covered them because I don't understand the field very thoroughly yet.
  Knowledge of shells is important for anyone who works on Linux
  regularly, more so for system administrators. There are similarities
  between shell programming and other kinds of scripting - often they
  can achieve the same goals, and you have the option of choosing
  between native shell and a separate scripting language. Among the most
  popular shells are bash, tcsh, csh, ksh and zsh. You can get basic
  information on your shell with the man command, man bash for example.

  2.4.  Other Languages

  Other languages of note: AWK, SED, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, Prolog,
  assembler, Objective C, Logo, Pascal (p2c converter)

  3.  GUI Toolkits

  The standard graphical subsystem for UNIX and Linux, called X, has its
  own libraries for GUI development. They provide a low-level
  programming interface to X, but tend to be hard to use. Old end-user
  applications and other toolkits of course make good use of them.
  Nowadays the Linux GUI scene is dominated by GTK+ and Qt, since two
  popular, complete user environments - GNOME and KDE - are based on
  them.

  3.1.  Concepts in the Table



     Library
        Common name or abbreviation of the toolkit.


     Beginner
        Whether the toolkit is suitable for a newbie programmer.


     License
        Different licenses for different GUI toolkits have practical
        significance. GTK+, TK and GNUstep licenses allow you to develop
        both open source and closed source applications without paying
        for a license. Motif license requires payment, while the QT
        license requires payment only if you write closed source
        programs.



     Language
        The language that is most often used with the toolkit.


     Bindings
        Other languages which can use the toolkit.


     Examples
        Applications that use the toolkit.


     Comments
        Additional information on the toolkit.
