  1.  Introduction

  1.1.  Notes

  This document first appeared in "Hideki Saito's Homepage" at

  .  This version of HOWTO is rewritten for updated information. HTML
  version is found in http://ryoohki.anime.net/ hideki/VAIO+Linux.html.
  You may distribute this document freely. When you publish it, please
  drop me a note; I just want know how this documents are used :)


  1.2.  Notes about different systems

  I've recently received some mail stating that some of contents in this
  document is incorrect. It is because some reason, hardware installed
  on more recent systems are slightly different than older systems. I
  will start covering those information. But since of course, I don't
  have every system in here, I would like to ask Sony VAIO owners to
  tell me more information about it. This would help me a lot if you can
  put [VAIO Information] in the beginning of the subject, so I can take
  extra attention to it. Also, please include model number of the
  system. If it is notebook, please include that information in a
  content, or in a subject. I would like to apologize to ones that got
  confused by this document.  (Addition: 12/29/98)


  1.3.  Update History

  12/29/98 Added several updates


  1.4.  Disclaimer

  Also most of procedures in this document is tested, I will take no
  responsibilities for any problem caused by using any information in
  this document. As like in GPL, please try anything in your own risk. I
  am not native English writer, and you will find many mistakes in this
  document. Please excuse me on those. Any corrections and
  clarifications are welcome; please send those to hideki@chatlink.com.


  1.5.  What this document all about?

  In this HOWTO, I will go over how to use Linux under Sony VAIO
  computers. The VAIO computers are great, but was not very friendly to
  Linux.  But this isn't mean that you cannot use it, actually you can!
  Throughout this document, I will assume that you own either PCV 70 or
  90.  Since almost all VAIO models are similar in their architecture
  (although newer ones have larger disks, updated video card, more RAM,
  etc), many of contents in this document should apply to all VAIO
  models.



  2.  Hardware compatibilities issue


  2.1.  Hardware that not compatible with Linux

  Most of hardwares installed in the system are compatible under Linux.
  However there are exceptions of modem, USB Port and MPEG decoder.
  Please be aware that you cannot use modem, which should be problem for
  some of you. Modems installed in the VAIO is called DSVD modem, which
  is the variant of the "Winmodem."

  (Addition: 12/28/98) Newer model seems to have normal modem instead of
  Winmodem.


  2.2.  Partially compatible hardwares

  The soundcard and the Video card installed are partially compatible.


  2.2.1.  Soundcard

  Soundcard is compatible under Linux with supports of Microsoft Sound
  System + Sound Blaster, if you want to use MIDI under Linux, you need
  to compromise your sound input capabilities.  For this case, cancel
  out the Sound Blaster.  If you need MIDI, and sound input, you may
  want consider buying OSS/Linux, which you can use all of its
  capabilities under Linux.  The soundcard equipped with the VAIO is
  Yamaha OPL3SA, and OSS/Linux has full support to it.  It seems like
  that the wavetable synthesis mentioned in the specification is really
  the soft synthesizer, so you are not missing hardware capabilities on
  it. As the time I am writing this, there is the OSS/Free 3.8, which
  supports this soundcard under Yamaha OPL3-SA1 audio controller. Please
  note that this is not initially installed on 2.0.x. You will need to
  download from OSS site. 2.1.x comes with updated version of OSS/Free,
  but I haven't tested compatibility with it. If you see that it is
  working with this soundcard, please let me know.


  2.2.2.  Video Card

  Videocard is partially supported under Linux.  You will have no
  problem using it under Linux console mode.  If you wish to use it
  under X Window, get 3.3.1 or later XFree86, which has support to ATI
  Rage.  Other commercial X Window system should support this, too.
  However, 3D acceleration of this video card will not work under Linux,
  as there is no driver for this. (Update 12/29/98) For model number
  505, ALSA drivers on XFree86 V3.3.3 or later is compatible.


  3.  How to install Linux?

  Installing Linux on the system will not be big problem.  However, you
  need to aware that initially, there are one non-DOS partition on the
  system.  I have no idea what that partition is.  It is 400MB
  partition, and it is visible by running fdisk.  I simply deleted this
  partition to allocate it for Linux.  And I don't have any problem, so
  probably it must be something to do with software installation.
  (Update 12/29/98) This 400MB partition is only on older models, it
  really supporsed to be another 400MB DOS partition, but Sony made
  mistake on it.  Please refer to other instruction for general
  installation of Linux.  The VAIO has nice support that you can boot
  directly from CD-ROM, if CD-ROM is bootable.  Since the BIOS supports
  it, it is what you can use in some distribution.  This is nice,
  because you can perform floppyless installation.  Particularly, Redhat
  could boot from CD-ROM.  Other distribution like SUSE also claims that
  it can boot from CD-ROM.  But as I have not checked those yet, I
  cannot be sure on that. If that this way of booting does not work with
  yours, try checking boot option in the BIOS.  Kernel configuration
  shouldn't be big problem except for the part to setup soundcard.  But
  as I covered that issue earlier, I will not talk about it in this
  section.  The VAIO computer is equipped with APM BIOS, or Advanced
  Power Management BIOS, I personally don't recommend that you enable
  support to it under Linux.  I had problem when I enabled it. (Update
  12/29/98) I have received report that with 505, CD-ROM install is
  difficult and network install is much easier.


  4.  After all...

  Everything went well?  I hope it did.  Now your Sony VAIO computer is
  one of the best Linux workstation.  If you have any problem, I may
  have answer to your questions.  Please just send those to
  hideki@chatlink.com anytime.  I will try to answer those as soon as
  possible.

  6.  Special thanks

  I would like to thank to following people, not in any particular

  section, please let me know by mail. (recentlly I lost big portion of
  my mail spool by accident, so it maybe the case)
