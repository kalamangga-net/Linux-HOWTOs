  1.  Introduction

  Any language setup, other than the original American English, has two
  issues:

  1. Displaying the right characters (fonts) - for Hebrew it's
     ISO-8859-8 standard.

  2. Mapping the keyboard.

  There is much more to Hebrew than that (like right to left, geometry
  in X-Windows,etc), but this HOWTO (at least for the first draft) deals
  only with the basic issues.

  More information can be found in the various "national" HOWTOs
  (German, Danish, etc.) and in the ISO 8859-1 HOWTO
  (ftp://ftp.vlsivie.tuwien.ac.at/pub/8bit
  <ftp://ftp.vlsivie.tuwien.ac.at/pub/8bit>  FAQ-ISO-8859-1).


  1.1.  Changes.


  o  FIRST DRAFT to 0.2.

     Most of this file is taken from the first draft by Vlad Moseanu.

  o  0.2 to 0.3Beta.

     Added excerpts from documents from the archive e-brew.zip from
     ftp://ftp.jer1.co.il/pub/software/msdos/communication
     <ftp://ftp.jer1.co.il/pub/software/msdos/communication>, and some
     bug fixes with the help of JCT Linux-il group members.

  o  0.3Beta to 0.4.

     After the first release of the Hebrew-HOWTO to the Linux-il it
     contain all the E-mail send to me regarding spelling/grammer and
     Tex-Xet, Mule and Vim info.


  1.2.  Thanks

  This HOWTO prepared by the help of all the group: Linux-il - 'The
  Israeli Linux users group' and especially by:

  The Linux-il group      (Linux-il@hagiga.jct.ac.il)

  Vlad Moseanu            (vlad@actcom.co.il)

  Gili Granot             (gil@csc.cs.technion.ac.il)

  Harvey J. Stein         (hjstein@math.huji.ac.il)

  Dovie Adler             (dadler@hobbes.jct.ac.il)

  Gavrie Philipson        (gavrie@shekel.jct.ac.il)


  2.  Standards for representation of Hebrew characters



  2.1.  ASCII

  To make one thing clear, for once and forever: There is no such thing
  as 8-bit ASCII. ASCII is only 7 bits. Any 8-bit code is not ASCII, but
  that doesn't mean it's not standard. ISO-8859-8 is standard, but not
  ASCII. Thanks!


  2.2.  DOS Hebrew

  The Hebrew encoding starts at 128d for Aleph. Therefore, encoding
  requires 8 bits. This is what you have on the Video card EPROM
  hardware fonts, all of the Hebrew DOS based editors use this table
  (Qtext, HED, etc.).


  2.3.  ISO Hebrew

  The Hebrew encoding starts at 224 for Aleph. This is the Internet
  standard, international standard and basically the standard for Ms-
  Windows and for Macintoshes (Dagesh, etc...).


  2.4.  OLD PC Hebrew

  This is 7-bit, and obsolete, as it occupies essentially the same ASCII
  range as English lowercase letters. So, it is best avoided. However,
  when ISO Hebrew gets its eighth bit stripped off by some ignorant Unix
  mail program (so you get a jumble of English letters for the Hebrew
  part of your message and the regular English, reversed or not, mixed
  in), you will get this, and will need to transform it to PC or ISO. If
  there was English mixed in with the Hebrew, this will be a sad
  situation, as you will either get Hebrew plus jumble, or English plus
  jumble...


  2.5.  Conversions

  Here are some simple scripts to convert from each standard to the
  other:


       DOS - ISO:      tr '\200-\232' '\340-\372' < {dos_file} > {iso_file}
       ISO - DOS:      tr '\340-\372' '\200-\232' < {iso_file} > {dos_file}
       OLD - DOS:      tr -z '\200-\232' < {old_Hebrew_file} > {dos_file}



  NOTE:   The numbers use by tr are in octal!


  3.  Virtual Consoles (VCs)

  Every distribution of Slackware comes with kbd; the package is called
  keytbls under Slackware (a4 in 2.3.0 - kbd 0.90). Joel Hoffman has
  contributed Hebrew fonts and keymaps from his original codepage.tar.Z
  file. Look under /usr/lib/kbd for iso08.* files. It follows ISO 8859-8
  and the Hebrew keytables and maps.

  Put the following lines in /etc/rc.d/rc.local:



  -----
  #!/bin/sh
  #       Put any local setup commands in here
  #
  INITTY=/dev/tty[1-6]
  PATH=/sbin:/etc:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
  #
  #       kbd - Set the the console font and keyboard
  #       set numlock and set metabit mode on tty1 .. tty8
  for tty in $INITTY
  do
  #       setleds -D +num < $tty > /dev/null
          setmetamode metabit < $tty > /dev/null
  done
  #       Latin8(Hebrew) keyboard/console
  setfont iso08.f16
  mapscrn trivial
  loadkeys Hebrew
  #       enable mapping
  for tty in $INITTY
  do
          echo -n -e "\\033(K" >$tty
  done
  -----



  NOTE: If you are using X Windows be careful with "setleds", it may
  hang the X server.

  The above setup works fine with the Hebrew version of pico (pine) and
  displays correctly ISO 8859-8 Hebrew (X Windows, MS Windows).


  4.  X Windows setup - XFree86 3.1

  4.1.  Hebrew fonts.

  XFree86 3.1 comes with two Hebrew fonts: heb6x13, heb8x13. Additional
  Hebrew fonts can be found on the Net:

  o  The web Type1 fonts (Helvetica/David style (proportional) and
     Courier/Shalom Stick style (fixed space) ) from the snunit-project
     archive at ftp://snunit.huji.ac.il/pub/fonts/
     <ftp://snunit.huji.ac.il/pub/fonts/>, it's good for netscape Hebrew
     pages.

  o  Avner Lottem, (lottem@techUnix.technion.ac.il) put some Hebrew-ISO
     8859-8 fonts on archive at
     ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/hebxfonts-0.1.tgz
     <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/>, it has a font that's
     good for dosemu under X-Windows (read his README file).


  4.2.  Installing fonts


  o  Fonts exaptable: pcf (Portable Compiled Format), bdf (Bitmap
     Distribution Format), pfb (Type1 fonts).

  o  Move the fonts to some existing directory (/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc)
     or create a new one (/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Hebrew). compress (to *.Z)
     the fonts to save space (NOT GZIP!!!).


  o  Run the mkfontdir to create/re-create the fonts.dir and edit
     fonts.alias (optional) to define new aliases.

  o  For Type1 fonts, mkfontdir does nothing. You have to add these
     fonts to fonts.dir manually.

  o  Make sure that the directory is in the X server path. Edit the
     XF86Config and add the appropriate path -- FontPath
     "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/...".


  4.3.  Making an X application to use Hebrew fonts.

  In short you need to set the appropriate resource.


  4.3.1.  Xterm

  Put the following line in the $HOME/.Xresources:

  xterm*font:  heb8x13

  or simply start xterm with xterm -fn heb8x13 The above font is way too
  small, so search for a better one ...  See the comments/examples on
  starting X11.

  4.3.2.  Netscape

  Usaly you can use the hebrew fonts from ``snunit - webfonts'', Install
  it ``as described'', and then put the next defaults in your local
  .Xdefaults or in the app-defaults/Netscape.


       ----
       *documentFonts.latin1.variable.italic*slant:            r
       *documentFonts.latin1.variable.boldItalic*slant:        r
       *documentFonts.latin1.variable*family:                  web
       *documentFonts.latin1.fixed*family:                     webmono
       *documentFonts.latin1*registry:                         iso8859
       *documentFonts.latin1*encoding:                         8
       ----



  In general you can put any fonts insted of the webfonts files as long
  as its supported by X11 ``as described''.

  4.4.  Mapping the keyboard.

  For some reason the X server doesn't inherit the keymap from the
  previous paragraph, and anyway I would like to define ALT Left and ALT
  Right and Scroll Lock. When pressing ALT together with some key it
  will generate a Hebrew character, Scroll Lock will lock in Hebrew
  mode.

  To do that we need to use xmodmap. Following is a Xmodmap which also
  corrects the bugs with the "Num Lock":

  To use the Xmodmap above define "Scroll-Lock  Mode-Lock" in the
  XF86Config.


  4.5.  Integrating all the above, examples.

  If you are using xdm a $HOME/.xsession should look like the following:



  -----
  #!/bin/sh
  # $XConsortium: Xsession,v 1.9 92/08/29 16:24:57 gildea Exp $
  #
  # General defs
  #
  export OPENWINHOME=/usr/openwin
  export MANPATH=/usr/local/man:/usr/man/preformat:/usr/man:/usr/X11R6/man
  #export HOSTNAME="`cat /etc/HOSTNAME`"
  export PATH="/bin: /usr/bin: /usr/X11/bin: /usr/X386/bin: /usr/TeX/bini: /usr/local/bin: /usr/games:."
  LESS=-MM
  if [ -z $XAPPLRESDIR ]; then
          XAPPLRESDIR=/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults:/usr/local/lib/X11/app-defaults
  else
          XAPPLRESDIR=$XAPPLRESDIR:/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults
  fi
  export XAPPLRESDIR
  #
  sysresources=/usr/lib/X11/Xresources
  sysmodmap=/usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap
  resources=$HOME/.Xresources
  xmodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap
  if [ -f $sysresources ]; then
          xrdb -merge $sysresources
  fi
  if [ -f $sysmodmap ]; then
          xmodmap $sysmodmap
  fi
  if [ -f $resources ]; then
          xrdb -merge $resources
  fi
  if [ -f $xmodmap ]; then
          xmodmap $xmodmap
  fi
  #
  # Start applications
  #
  # xterm -ls -sb &
  xhost +                 # look out !!!
  exec fvwm

  If you prefer startx use the above as an example for .xinitrc.


  5.  Shells setup.

  For more details read the ``ISO 8859-1'' HOWTO.


  5.1.  bash

  Create a $HOME/.inputrc contain the following:



       -----
       set meta-flag On
       set convert-meta Off
       set output-meta On
       -----


  5.2.  tcsh

  Define the following in the $HOME/.login or /etc/csh.login:
       setenv LANG iw_IL.ISO8859-8 (or iw_IL) Actually because the
  binary version of tcsh is complied without nls the LANG can be set to
  anything and it will still work (no need for /usr/lib/nls...).  The
  lang. name also shows my Digital bias ...


  6.  Applications

  6.1.  Vim


  o  The Vim is a Vi IMproved editor with some enhanced commands and the
     hebrew support was made bu Dov Grobgeld (HED developer).

  o  Another Vim patch announced by Avner Lottem,
     lottem@techunix.technion.ac.il and can be obtained from
     ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/editors/vi/vim3.0-rlh0.1.tgz
     <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/editors/vi/vim3.0-rlh0.1.tgz>.

  o  For more info, you can look at
     http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gil/var.html
     <http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gil/var.html>

  6.2.  Hebrew pine and pico

  The pine and it's additional editor pico had been changed by Helen
  Zommer from CC-huji and has a bug-report mail: pineh-
  bug@horizon.cc.huji.ac.il. It can be down-loaded from
  ftp://horizon.cc.huji.ac.il/pub <ftp://horizon.cc.huji.ac.il/pub>.


  6.3.  Some emacs Hebrew ports.


  o  Hebrew package by Joseph Friedman. It includes some Hebrew fonts in
     BDF format, patch for emacs 18.58 and an elisp package. It is fine,
     but nobody uses emacs 18.* anymore. It can be obtained from:
     ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-
     archive/misc/Hebrew.tar.Z <ftp://archive.cis.ohio-
     state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/Hebrew.tar.Z>.

  o  A very simple Hebrew package. Includes only right-to-left cursor
     movement support and right-to-left sorting. Works without any
     patches with FSF emacs 19. Can be obtained from
     ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-
     archive/misc/Hebrew.el.Z <ftp://archive.cis.ohio-
     state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/Hebrew.el.Z>.

  o  One of emacs branches - MULE (Multi Lingual Emacs) Supports a lot
     of languages including Hebrew. It compiles and runs under Linux
     with no problem.  It is full Emacs, with Hebrew support and double-
     direction handling. It can be obtained from:
     ftp://kelim.jct.ac.il/pub/Hebrew <ftp://kelim.jct.ac.il/pub/Hebrew>


  6.4.  Dosemu

  For a VC dosemu you can use your Hebrew from the Video card EPROM, and
  if you don't have it there are plenty of Hebrew dos fonts from EGA
  support to the VGA Hebrew support.

  For X-Windows support you should download the file:
  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/hebxfonts-0.1.tgz
  <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/hebxfonts-0.1.tgz> it's
  contain some fonts include one called vgah.pcf that you should install
  it on your fonts directory as describe ``above'' the fonts are:


  6.5.  XHTerm

  There is a main port of the regular X-Term program for use with a
  Hebrew fonts - XHTerm =  xterm +  Hebrew support. The port for a sun
  machine was made avalible by the help of Danny
  <tt>danny@cs.huji.ac.il</tt>. Evgeny has some patch for use this port
  under Linux. His version should come with a pre-compiled XHTerm for
  both X11R5 and X11R6. You should use xhterm with the option -fn and a
  Hebrew font ``as described''!  Danny's port (for SUN) can be obtained
  from: ftp://ftp.huji.ac.il/pub/local/xhterm
  <ftp://ftp.huji.ac.il/pub/local/xhterm> and the patched version of
  Evgeny Stambulchik is on: ftp://plasma-
  gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/software/linux <ftp://plasma-
  gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/software/linux> Get it from there and you'll
  get 5 ``fonts with  it'': [heb10x20.pcf, heb6x13.bdf, heb6x13.pcf,
  heb8x13.bdf, heb8x13.pcf]


  6.6.  TeX--XeT - Hebrew Tex.

  The bigest problem with Tex with Hebrew is that the charecters should
  go backwards relative to Visual look (i.e. pico inserts the charecters
  from right to left), so the best thing is to get XHterm with a regular
  emacs and write the Hebrew left to right, backwards as well.

  The newer NTeX distribution on sunsite (v1.5) includes everything,
  including TeX--XeT, precompiled for Linux. It can be obtained from
  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu.gz/pub/Linux/apps/tex/ntex
  <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu.gz/pub/Linux/apps/tex/ntex>. An older version
  of TeX--XeT can be obtained from ftp://noa.huji.ac.il/tex
  <ftp://noa.huji.ac.il/tex>. This older version, however, has to be
  recompiled (not recommended).

  These TeX distributions are fine if you use LaTeX2.09. If you want to
  use LaTeX2e (the current de facto standard) you have a problem.  Alon
  Ziv (alonz@csa.cs.technion.ac.il) is currently working in support for
  LaTeX2e with Hebrew, using the Babel languages system. I don't know
  the current status of his work -- ask him!


  7.  Printer setup

  Mainly there is not to say, if you have a regular ASCII line printer
  (who does, these days?) there is a good chance that there are Hebrew
  fonts in it on the EPROM chip.

  If you use PostScript, you should download soft fonts to the printer
  (you can always use the ``earlier mentioned'' Web fonts for that.
  These fonts are also useable with Ghostscript).

  If you have a PCL printer (LaserJet etc.), you can either use font
  cartridges or use Ghostscript.


  8.  Commercial products.

  8.1.  El-Mar software.

  The Hebrew Support for X-Windows & Motif, is a product of El-Mar
  Software, which adds Hebrew functionality to many of the parts and
  layers of X-Windows and Motif, including Xlib, all of the widgets of
  Motif, hterm (Hebrew xterm), demos and simple useful applications
  (e.g. bi-lingual Motif-based editor), fonts (including scalable
  Type1), keyboard-manager in order to allow Hebrew and push-mode for
  non-Motif applications, etc.

  Despite allowing many new features and variations for Motif widgets,
  the support doesn't have any modification to internal data-structures
  of Motif, so existing applications which were compiled and linked
  under non-Hebrew environment and libraries, can be relinked (without
  compilation!) and run with Hebrew (you can replace shared-libraries,
  so even the relink is not needed!)

  By using another tool of us, Motif/Xplorer, you can take commercial
  applications (without their source) and translate them to Hebrew. This
  was the way of giving Hebrew support for Oracle Forms 4, Intellicorp's
  Kappa and OMW, CA-Unicenter, and many other leading UNIX tools sold in
  Israel. This product was purchased and adopted by most of the
  workstation vendors (9 of them, including the biggest: Sun, HP, SGI),
  and many other software houses.  There are Makefiles for more than 30
  platforms and operating systems.

  We believe only in open software, so all the customers get the
  compelete source code. We have good relations with the leading forces
  in this industry, including the technical staff of X-Consortium and
  the technical staff of COSE.
